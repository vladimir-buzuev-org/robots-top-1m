# This file is to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts
# of your site by web crawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo!
# and Google. By telling these "robots" where not to go on your site,
# you save bandwidth and server resources.

# This file will be ignored unless it is at the root of your host:
# Used:    http://example.com/robots.txt
