# Paths
Disallow: /index.php/
# removing /catalog path disallow for google sitemap to crawl catalog pages.  Currently not crawled due to robots.txt block
# From May 12th 2.00pm to May 13th 4.00pm we have lot of hits on catalog page due to crawling - this aided to reach Redis to reach peak # of 16GB memory and casued app resposne time to 20s to 25 seconds.  Due to this reason again disallowing /catalog to avoid crawing.  # This is the first time we had crawl for 1 day - earlier it used to finish to 2 to 4 hours.
