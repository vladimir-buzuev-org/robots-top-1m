            counterfeit items cannot be offered for sale, generally no auction 
            site will guarantee the authenticity of the products sold and 
            counterfeit goods are often available. Most auction sites make money 
            based on the listing or sale of goods including counterfeit goods. <br>
                    <br>
            Due to the explosion of postings for counterfeit goods on 
            auction sites, companies like CHANEL cannot always monitor them for 
            counterfeits and cannot and do not guarantee the authenticity of the 
            products sold. CHANEL and companies like CHANEL have repeatedly 
            requested that auction sites take direct responsibility for 
            monitoring their sites and for ensuring that unlawful merchandise is 
            not offered for sale but counterfeits continue to be available on
