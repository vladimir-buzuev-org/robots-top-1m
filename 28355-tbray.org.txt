# http://www.tbray.org's robots policy:
# 
# It has to be a win-win with a reasonable cost-benefit trade-off.
# That is to say, you can crawl me at my expense if you offer something
# of roughly comparable value in return, as for example well-run search 
# engines do.
#
# If you're looking for stolen term papers or brand-theft, sorry, I don't
# do that kind of thing and I don't need you spending my money to prove it.
# 
# If you're a search engine but stupidly-implemented, you'll get locked out.
