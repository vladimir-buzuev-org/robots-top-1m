	will be promoted throughout each week day or visit www.thistv.com to find the valid toll-free phone number 

	through which you can enter the Sweepstakes every day. To enter, call the valid toll-free phone number: 

	1-855-484-4788 (the <span>&#34;</span>Friday Flick Pick Phone Number<span>&#34;</span>) from a touch-tone telephone. All connected calls to 

	the Friday Flick Pick Phone Number during a Daily Entry Period as verified by Sponsor will receive an entry 

	to the Sweepstakes for such Daily Entry Period. Entries will not be carried forward into subsequent Daily 

	Entry Periods. You will receive the entry into the Sweepstakes as soon as your call to the toll-free phone 

	number is picked up. You may be asked to complete a daily survey and review third party offers. You will also 

	be offered one additional bonus entry per Daily Entry Period in the Sweepstakes if you select one or more 

	third partyoffers, as described at the time of your call. Callers may select a third party offer by pressing 

	the <span>&#34;</span>1<span>&#34;</span> key on their telephone keypad while or immediately after listening to a particular offer. When the

	<span>&#34;</span>1<span>&#34;</span> key is pressed, the bonus entry will be confirmed and the callers will be prompted to confirm that they

	wish to be connected with the advertiser associated with the selected offer. Callers are not required to purchase

    any products or services from advertisers in order to receive the bonus entry to the Sweepstakes. Purchasing a 

	third party offer does not increase your chances of winning. Entrants<span>&#39;</span> phone numbers will not be used for 

	commercial purposes, other than for communicating and fulfilling any selected offers. Any use of entrants<span>&#39;</span> 

	phone numbers by advertisers and/or Sweepstakes Entities shall comply with the Telecommunications Consumer 

	Protection Act. You can call from a landline or a mobile phone; please note that standard charges levied by phone

	carriers may apply.</p>

	shall be offered one (1) additional bonus entry as described above. By participating in The ThisTV Friday Flick 

	Pick Sweepstakes, you unconditionally accept and agree to comply with these Official Rules and decisions of 

	Sponsor, which are final and binding in all respects.

	Limit: Each entrant may receive one (1) entry per day during the Promotion Period, except when entrants 

	playing in a Daily Entry Period are offered one (1) additional bonus entry as described above. Multiple 

	entrants are not permitted to share the same phone number. Multiple entries received from one person or phone 

	number after the first entry received from that person or phone number will be void. Use of any automated system 

	to participate is prohibited and may result in disqualification. In the event of a dispute as to any entry, the 

	authorized account holder of the phone number used to enter will be deemed to be the entrant. The authorized 

	account holder is the natural person assigned a phone number by a phone service provider or the authorized user 

	if the phone number belongs to a business. The potential winner may be required to show proof of being the 

	authorized account holder or user.

	(5) potential winners from among all eligible entries received on each Daily Entry Period. Limit one (1) prize 

	per person. Each entrant selected must comply with all terms and conditions of these Official Rules, and winning

	is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements. Each potential winner will be notified by phone, through the phone

	number that he or she called from to enter, within ten (10) days following the end of the Daily Entry Period. 

	Should an entrant win, he/she must be available at the phone number used to enter the Sweepstakes to receive

	his/her win notification and instructions on how to claim his/her Prize; Sponsor is not responsible for changes

	in entrants' phone numbers. If a potential winner cannot be contacted within five (5) days of the first attempt

	to contact him/her, the Prize is returned as undeliverable, such potential winner forfeits his/her Prize. 

	Sponsor will notify potential winners on their voice message system if available that Sponsor is attempting to 

	reach them and will provide a return phone number to call. In the event the potential winner cannot be reached 

	and does not respond within the above time period, an alternate entrant will be selected in his/her place at 

	random from among all eligible remaining entries received for the applicable Daily Entry Period. Only one

	(1) alternate drawing will be held, after which such Prize will remain un-awarded. Each winner will receive

	his/her Prize 4-6 weeks by mail after winner verification.

	responsible for any and all applicable fees and taxes associated with Prize receipt and use. The odds of being

	television network or any factor beyond Sponsor<span>&#39;</span>s reasonable control corrupts the administration, security, 

	fairness, integrity or proper operation of the Sweepstakes. In such event, Sponsor reserves the right to award

	the Prize at random from among the eligible entries received up to the time of impairment. Sponsor reserves the 

	right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or 

	the operation of the Sweepstakes or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in an unsportsmanlike 

	or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately damage Sponsor's or the thistv.com website or 

	undermine the legitimate operation of this Sweepstakes may be a violation of criminal and civil laws, and, should 

	such an attempt be made, Sponsor and other Sweepstakes Entities reserve the right to seek damages from any such 

	person to the fullest extent permitted by law. Sponsor's failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules 

	shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.

	agree to release and hold harmless the Sweepstakes Entities from any and all liability resulting or arising from 

	the Sweepstakes, to release all rights to bring any claim, action or proceeding against the Sweepstakes Entities, 

	and hereby acknowledge that said Sweepstakes Entities have neither made nor are in any manner responsible or 

	liable for any warranty, representation or guarantee, express or implied, in fact or in law, relative to a Prize.

	Sweepstakes Entities shall not be liable for any injury, damage, loss, expense, accident, delay, inconvenience or

	irregularity that may be caused or contributed to (1) by any wrongful, negligent or unauthorized act or omission 

	on the part of the prize supplier or any of its agents, employees or independent contractors, (2) by any wrongful, negligent or unauthorized act or omission on the part of any other person or entity not an employee of Sweepstakes Entity, or (3) by any other cause, condition or event whatsoever beyond the control of Sweepstakes Entity. The failure of Sweepstakes Entity to comply with any provision of these Official Rules due to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire, riot, earthquake, labor strike, terrorism, act of public enemies, action of governmental authorities outside of the control of Sponsor (excepting compliance with applicable codes and regulations) or other force majeure event will not be considered a breach of these Official Rules.

	</p>

	<p>The Sweepstakes Entities are not responsible for: (1) incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by 

	entrants, printing errors or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Sweepstakes;

	(2) technical failures of any kind, including but not limited to the malfunctions, interruptions or 

	disconnections in phone lines or network, hardware or software; (3) unauthorized human intervention in 

	any part of the entry process or the Sweepstakes; (4) technical or human error which may occur in the 

	administration of the Sweepstakes or the processing of entries; (5) late, lost, undeliverable, damaged or stolen 

	mail; or (6) any injury or damage to persons or property, including but not limited to entrant's computer, which 

	may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entrant's participation in the Sweepstakes, 

	receipt, possession or use or misuse of any Prize, or from downloading any material from Sponsor's or any other 

	Sweepstakes Entity’s website(s), regardless of whether the material was prepared by Sponsor, any other Sweepstakes

	Entity or a third party, and regardless of whether the material is connected to Sponsor's or the thistv.com 

	website by a hypertext link. If, for any reason, an entrant's entry is confirmed to have been erroneously 

	deleted, lost, or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, entrant’s sole remedy is another entry in the Sweepstakes, 

	provided that, if it is not possible to award another entry due to discontinuance of the Sweepstakes, or any part

	of it, for any reason, Sponsor, in its sole discretion, may elect to hold a random drawing from among all eligible

	entries received up to the date of discontinuance for any or all of the Prizes offered herein. In such event, 

	Sponsor shall only hold a special drawing if potential entrant can prove, from a valid, written phone company 

	record, that a call was made to the ThisTV phone number on the date of claimed entry. No more than the stated 

	number of Prizes will be awarded. In the event that production, technical, seeding, programming or any other 

	reasons cause more than the stated number of Prizes as set forth in these Official Rules to be available and/or 

	claimed, Sponsor reserves the right to award only the stated number of Prizes by a random drawing among all 

	legitimate, un-awarded, eligible Prize claims.</p>

	<section><p><span class='numList'><b>11. Disputes.</b></span> Entrant agrees that: (1) any and all disputes, 

	claims, and causes of action arising out of or connected with this Sweepstakes, or any Prizes awarded, 

	shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York, (without regard to the conflict of law provisions 

	thereof) and resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action, and exclusively by the American

	Arbitration Association (<span>&#34;</span>AAA<span>&#34;</span>) for final and binding arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules to be 

	held in New York, New York, before a single arbitrator who shall be a retired judge, in accordance with New York

	Civil Practice Law & Rules Section 7501 et seq. The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the

	general public. The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion stating the essential findings and conclusions upon 

	which the arbitrator<span>&#39;</span>s award is based. The parties will share equally in payment of the arbitrator<span>&#39;</span>s fees and 

	arbitration expenses and any other costs unique to the arbitration hearing (recognizing that each side bears its

	of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein
