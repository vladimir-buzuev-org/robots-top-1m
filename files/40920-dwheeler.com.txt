# Ignore "frozen" files - they are merely copies of the real thing.
# Also ignore secure-programs/old; they're old versions, and at least
# one robot (Teleport Pro/1.28) seems to go completely out of control
# if presented directly with a directory to index.
# I _could_ just block Teleport Pro, but I don't really want indexing
# to lead people to old versions instead of current material anyway.
