                <h2>About Movable Type Support Services</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is highly recommended that the MT User read through the official Movable Type Manual prior to contacting customer support. Depending on the question, answers from customer support might be exactly the same as information provided in the manual.</li>
                    <li>Questions related to Movable Type and official plugins can be answered by customer support.

                    <li>Support is offered for as long as the MT User’s product license is valid. If Six Apart discovers that the MT User has invalidated their user agreement, the provided support time period can be shortened or canceled.</li>
