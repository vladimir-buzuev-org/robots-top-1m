This means that each individual piece is printed, embroidered or equipped with trimmings in accordance with precise requirements, finally becoming a real part of your team.","Finishing.cm.2.headline":"99% of our products","Finishing.cm.2.body":"are customised with logos, lettering, trimmings or graphic motifs.","Finishing.cm.3.headline":"TWO THINGS THAT BELONG TOGETHER","Finishing.cm.3.body":"Starting with the design of the fabric surface, we ensure that each surface is suitable for as many customisation techniques as possible. It's the interplay between ideal surface and appropriate print or neat embroidery that provides a successful and durable result.","Finishing.cm.5.headline":"THE CHOICE IS YOURS","Finishing.cm.5.body":"Our products provide the best possible conditions for finishing with the widest variety of customisation techniques. Your retailer knows them all and is best placed to give you great advice.","Finishing.cm.6.caption1":"SCREEN PRINTING","Finishing.cm.6.body1":"Different versions of screen printing offer a wide variety of design options and an almost unlimited colour spectrum. Photographic motifs and colour gradients can also be produced using screen printing. The colours are very resistant to the effects of light and weather conditions. This process lends itself to the cost-effective production of large runs.","Finishing.cm.6.caption2":"TRANSFER","Finishing.cm.6.body2":"This technique also permits the reproduction of the finest colour gradients and photos. The colours are pre-printed onto carrier paper using screen printing machines. The motif is then transferred onto the fabric using a transfer press to apply heat and pressure. As soon as the adhesive on the covering layer has cooled, the carrier film can be removed and the motif remains on the garment base. The print feels slightly rubberised and forms a sealed surface impermeable to air.","Finishing.cm.6.caption3":"EMBROIDERY","Finishing.cm.6.body3":"Embroidery is the most elegant and durable form of customisation. It is suitable for almost all fabrics and base materials. The image for the embroidered motif is first digitised and then embroidered using the latest multi-head embroidery machines. We have over 500 different colours of embroidery thread for you to choose from. Up to 15 colours can be used simultaneously in a single embroidery run.","Finishing.cm.7.headline":"NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE","Finishing.cm.7.body":"Even when designing our styles, we have an idea of how they will be customised later.

Our Performance clothing in particular gets dirty so often that it is impossible to get it clean in a normal household wash. This is why we have equipped the entire collection for commercial laundries—with MikraLinar®, the strong fibre mix developed here at HAKRO, a rental label for marking, zips and buttons able to withstand the stresses and strains of commercial laundry and two practical hanging tabs.","Washing.cm.2.headline":"6% and no more","Washing.cm.2.body":"is how much a HAKRO T-shirt can shrink when cared for correctly. \n","Washing.cm.3.headline":"ANYTHING BUT FAINT-HEARTED","Washing.cm.3.body":"As long as you observe the care instructions, our corporate fashion garments can cope with anything.

You should always use this cycle for your clothes whenever possible.","Washing.cm.7.headline":"ADVANCED DURABILITY: COMMERCIAL LAUNDRY","Washing.cm.7.body":"Oil, grease, dirt… it all has to come out, at 60 degrees and with the drum stuffed full.
