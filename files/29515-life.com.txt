The confirmation was a crowning achievement in Marshall&#8217;s already long and illustrious legal career, which was well documented by LIFE Magazine in the years leading up to that day. As shown by these LIFE photos of his career in the years between 1949 and 1967, he was &mdash; as the magazine once dubbed him &mdash; the &#8220;chief counsel for equality.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Working on behalf of the NAACP, he had tackled <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=-1YEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=%22thurgood+marshall%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH1Oe2p_DVAhUG5yYKHckWCX04ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22thurgood%20marshall%22&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">segregation<\/a> in courts across the South and Washington, D.C., and even his most dedicated opponents could not help but admit to his skill.

And yet that profile, written <a

As TIME described her privileged upbringing in <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/vault\/issue\/1981-04-20\/page\/1\/\">an April 20, 1981, cover package<\/a> published shortly after the then-19-year-old Diana became engaged to the Prince of Wales Charles, the house that the Spencer family rented from the Crown had the only heated pool in the area &mdash; and that pool was more than a symbol of wealth. Because Park House was part of the royal estate at Sandringham, the neighbors who came by to take advantage of the pool included the Windsor children. &#8220;Diana and Charles may have met a few times when she was a child and he already a young man, but everyone is fuzzy on the details,&#8221; the story noted.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>That pool was not the only indicator of her privilege, the story continued:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Diana attended West Heath, a boarding school in Kent, where she excelled in sports and recorded a middling result on standard exams known as O Levels. At 16, she spent twelve weeks at a Swiss finishing school, primarily to learn to ski but also to brush up on French, cooking, sewing and typing. Nothing much here for a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but perfectly fine, thanks, for the sort of genteel, pass-the-time employment that came Diana&#8217;s way: governess, cook, nanny, kindergarten teacher.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pages.email.time.com\/newsletters\/?newsletter_name=HISTORY&amp;source=article-history\"><em>Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>But, despite having all the makings of a happy childhood, that period could also be a solitary one for the young Diana. She had a strong connection with animals, doting on her Shetland pony and serving as head of &#8220;Pets&#8217; Corners&#8221; at her boarding school Riddlesworth Hall, but often spent time without many people around. Her parents&#8217; marriage having fallen apart before she was 10, the family home Althorp House could be &#8220;a lonely place&#8221; for Diana, Tina Brown, the former editor of <em>The<\/em><em> New Yorker<\/em> and <em>The <\/em><em>Daily Beast, <\/em>writes in the forward of the new book <em>Remembering Diana: A Life in Photographs. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A frequent erroneous press assumption,&#8221; she writes, &#8220;was that her distinguished aristocratic background meant familiarity with a grand, high-society world. In fact, Diana&#8217;s childhood was limited in its circle and almost feral in its neglect. She spent most of her free time with the servants below stairs (one reason, perhaps, she could communicate so well with ordinary people).&#8221;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"History","slug":"history","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/history\/","description":"The news in context, from the archives of TIME.

Wielding cardboard boxes and knives that today would surely get a kid suspended, the kids demonstrated for LIFE&rsquo;s readers how to safely look at an eclipse.<\/p>\n<p>During the solar eclipse of 1960, hundreds of people had suffered permanent eye damage from looking directly at the sun. With help from the Illinois Society for the Prevention of Blindness, Emerson students avoided the same fate by building Sunscopes, pinhole camera-like contraptions that indirectly project an image of the sun. The magazine offered instructions for those desiring to replicate the project at home:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>To build your own, get a carton and cut a hole in one side, big enough to poke your head through. Paste white paper on the inside surface that you will be facing. Then punch a pinhole into the opposite side, high enough so that the little shaft of light will miss your head. For a sharper image you can make a better pinhole by cutting a one inch square hole in the carton, taping a piece of aluminum foil over this hole and then making the pinhole in the foil. Finally, tape the box shut and cover all light leaks with black tape.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A final word to the wise from LIFE: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to come out for fresh air.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em>Liz Ronk, who edited this gallery, is the Photo Editor for LIFE.com.

(Hemingway&#8217;s cats may have drunk more than water, with one<a href=\"http:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/smart-news\/ernest-hemingway-taught-one-of-his-many-many-cats-to-drink-whisky-73691\/\" target=\"_blank\"> letter<\/a> suggesting the author fed one named &#8220;Friendless&#8221; whisky and milk when he was feeling lonely and wanted to drink with somebody.) And there&#8217;s Fred Astaire palling around in 1962 with the Siamese cat that fellow film star Kim Novak, also pictured, had given him. &#8220;Animals loved Daddy,&#8221; his daughter Ava later told <em>Vanity Fair<\/em>&#8216;s editor-at-large, Sarah Giles.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s also clear that a cat can be a star whether or not its owner is famous. For example, in 1958, when Navy doctor Dietrich Beischer used magnet boots to train a kitten to chase a mouse upside-down, to get a sense of how humans would deal with weightlessness, the cat played an important role in the history of space travel. And as for a cat in a funny hat or a cat eating corn on the cob &mdash; well, some things never change.

He personally trained all 13 of the horses he used to do his job, and his home on the range looked &#8220;exactly as a moviegover would expect.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But in that fact, LIFE acknowledged, lay one of the more subtle truths about the past and future of the cowboy lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>Even as C.H. Long was a living embodiment of a beloved, but endangered culture, he was already part of a myth forged by Hollywood and dime-store novels, not reality. He knew that the cowboy image that the the world celebrated was sometimes more appealing than even the most rewarding liberties of life on the cattle trail.<\/p>\n<p>And on his rare trips into town, he picked up magazines full of Western stories, which he dismissed as &#8220;claptrap&#8221;, but loved nonetheless, &#8220;forgetting his adventurous life to search for adventure in lurid accounts of wild affairs that never happened.&#8221;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"LIFE","slug":"life","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/life\/","description":"Classic Pictures From LIFE Magazine's Archives","life":true,"all_sections":["time-section-history","time-section-life"]},"tag":{"name":"photography","slug":"photography","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/photography\/"},"tags":"1949|Cowboy|Leonard McCombe|onetime|photography","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/iconic-cowboy-02.jpg?quality=85&w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/iconic-cowboy-02.jpg?quality=85&w=280","small_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/iconic-cowboy-02.jpg?quality=85&w=560","landscape_large":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/iconic-cowboy-02.jpg?quality=85&w=550&h=367&crop=1","large":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/iconic-cowboy-02.jpg?quality=85&w=550","large_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/iconic-cowboy-02.jpg?quality=85&w=1100","square":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/iconic-cowboy-02.jpg?quality=85&w=600&h=600&crop=1"},"credit":"Leonard McCombe\u2014The LIFE Images Collection\/Getty Images","caption":"<b>Caption from LIFE.<\/b> At sunset after a day's work, he collects his string of horses, considers which of the young ones to pick for a training session.","title":"Clarence H.

In his notes on the project, which were sent back to LIFE&#8217;s offices and have been preserved in the magazine&#8217;s archives, Mydans wrote that refugees were &#8220;a major problem&#8221; for the war effort. As they fled from the North to the South, filtering through the U.S. forces going the other way, their groups were infiltrated by North Korean fighters dressed as peasants, who would fire on the Americans from the rear as soon as they got past. Newly arriving units from Japan and the U.S. thus &#8220;vowed they would tolerate no such civilian movement&#8221; but quickly found that such a promise was a difficult one, as the civilians were not enemies and refusing to allow them to flee a war zone was not feasible, neither in a moral nor a practical sense.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>On Aug. 6, 1950, that problem was thrown into stark relief right in front of Mydans&#8217; eyes: Though the U.S. forces had made an effort to clear out all of the villages near their lines, to prevent the need for civilian movement, the American 1st Cavalry Division found itself face to face, across the shallow Naktong River, with more than 5,000 refugees hoping to cross. Behind the refugees were North Korean fighters. If a battle began between them and the Americans, the refugees were right in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>It was decided, Mydans noted, &#8220;with an understanding of the terrible conditions these war victims were in, with no homes, no food, and the almost sure danger that they would find themselves between two fires, when the river battle finally opened up,&#8221; that South Korean and American forces would screen them as they crossed.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What happened in the crossing, how they carried their young and old on their backs and heads,&#8221; Mydans wrote, was shown better in the photos than he could describe in words. &#8220;This is a picture story &mdash; the kind that make the few correspondents with me hope they could present this story in pictures rather than with the typewriter.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And yet, when a few of Mydans&#8217; photos ran in the magazine, the editors chose a selection of his words to accompany them, too &mdash; and in those words is a message that&#8217;s particularly relevant on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/events\/refugeeday\/\" target=\"_blank\">World Refugee Day<\/a>, which falls this year on Tuesday. The details may have been specific to Korea, he observed, but the plight of the refugee and the need to extend a helping hand was a universal one.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"><img src=\"https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/lazy-load\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/mydans-captions-korea-detail.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=85&#038;h=106\" data-attachment-id=\"4818836\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4817950\/north-korea-world-refugee-day\/mydans-captions-korea-detail\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/mydans-captions-korea-detail.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2405,455\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Carl Mydans Korea Notes Detail\" data-image-description=\"pDetail from field notes by Carl Mydans.\/p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/mydans-captions-korea-detail.jpg?quality=85&amp;w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/mydans-captions-korea-detail.jpg?quality=85&amp;w=600\" alt=\"Carl Mydans field notes from the Korean War\" height=\"106\"><noscript><img data-attachment-id=\"4818836\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4817950\/north-korea-world-refugee-day\/mydans-captions-korea-detail\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/mydans-captions-korea-detail.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2405,455\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Carl Mydans Korea Notes Detail\" data-image-description=\"pDetail from field notes by Carl Mydans.\/p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/mydans-captions-korea-detail.jpg?quality=85&w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/mydans-captions-korea-detail.jpg?quality=85&w=600\" src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/mydans-captions-korea-detail.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=85&#038;h=106\" alt=\"Carl Mydans field notes from the Korean War\" height=\"106\"><\/noscript>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >Detail from field notes by Carl Mydans.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&#8220;The despair on their faces was an old story,&#8221; the final story read. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen it in Finland, in France, in China.

It was also dangerous, especially when it came to the waves found off the North Shore of Oahu.<\/p>\n<p>The magazine kindly <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=mEkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA56#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">explained<\/a> to unfamiliar readers how the sport worked there: &#8220;The men who ride the big ones in Hawaii actually ski down the shoulder of a wave away from the curl&#8230; They call the first breathtaking schuss &#8216;taking the drop.&#8217; Their boards accelerate up to 35 mph so rapidly that they kick up waves like speedboats. And a merciless mauling awaits the unfortunate who doesn&#8217;t complete his ride. He is driven downward by the appalling maelstrom, tossed around, sucked back down and frequently, after fighting up for a desperate gulp of air, hammered down again by the next wave.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And yet a brave group of surfers &mdash; fewer than 100 people at that point, three of whom had been killed in 1962 &mdash; sought out the big waves anyway, for what LIFE called the &#8220;peril and ecstasy&#8221; of the sport&#8217;s toughest waves. Enabled by new innovations in balsa wood surfboards that had opened new vistas to surfers in the 1940s, they returned again and again, despite the risks.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at these color photos by George Silk, it&#8217;s not hard to see what drew the surfers back to the water. In honor of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.surfrider.org\/isd\" target=\"_blank\">International Surfing Day<\/a> on June 17, here&#8217;s a look back at what surfer Fred Van Dyke described to Silk as

It has also commemorated the struggle for a <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4010645\/womens-equality-day\/\">deeper<\/a> kind of equality in all realms of life.<\/p>\n<p>But, though much progress has been made toward that goal, some things have barely changed in decades. Case in point: LIFE magazine devoted a lengthy <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=mEgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA100#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">1947 story<\/a> to the &#8220;American woman&#8217;s dilemma,&#8221; and the details of that dilemma are problems still faced today. The sub-headline just about summed it up: &#8220;She wants a husband and she wants children. Should she go on working? Full time? Part time? Will housework bore her? What will she do when her children are grown?&#8221; These questions ring familiar to present-day debates about whether, and how, women can &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3453839\/kirsten-gillibrand-have-it-all\/\">have it all<\/a>.&#8221;<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In 1947, with the post-war United States awash in considerations of how women ought best to spend their lives, LIFE profiled how a selection of American women had answered that question. A generation before, the story noted, the women in the story would likely have been happy &mdash; or at least put on happy faces &mdash; about seeing marriage as a &#8220;complete future.&#8221; But when the story was published, they could be businesswomen, lawyers, factory workers, gardeners, harpists, television announcers, secretaries or housewives, like the woman featured in the photos above &mdash; who, the story noted, did that work a whopping 100 hours a week, even with the help of modern appliances.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-medium alignleft \"><img src=\"https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/lazy-load\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/08\/womans-dilema-chores.jpg?w=300&#038;quality=85&#038;h=288\" data-attachment-id=\"4901991\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4901910\/american-womans-dilemma-womens-equality\/housewife\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/08\/womans-dilema-chores.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1553,1490\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" Marjorie McWeeney broom amidst symbolic display of her store beds to be items glass pieces silverware food some data-image-title=\"1947 Woman\u2019s Dilemma\" data-image-description=\"pHousewife Marjorie McWeeney w. broom amidst symbolic display of her week\u2019s housework at Bloomingdale\u2019s store incl. 35 beds to be made, 750 items of glass &amp; china, 400 pieces of silverware to wash, 174 lbs. of food to prepare, some of 250 pieces of laundry\/p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/08\/womans-dilema-chores.jpg?quality=85&amp;w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/08\/womans-dilema-chores.jpg?quality=85&amp;w=600\" alt=\"The American woman&#039;s dilemma in 1947 from LIFE magazine.\" height=\"288\"><noscript><img data-attachment-id=\"4901991\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4901910\/american-womans-dilemma-womens-equality\/housewife\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/08\/womans-dilema-chores.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1553,1490\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"NINA LEEN\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Housewife Marjorie McWeeney w. broom amidst symbolic display of her week's housework at Bloomingdale's store incl. 35 beds to be made, 750 items of glass & china, 400 pieces of silverware to wash, 174 lbs. of food to prepare, some of 250 pieces of laundry\",\"created_timestamp\":\"-712800000\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"HOUSEWIFE\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"1947 Woman\u2019s Dilemma\" data-image-description=\"pHousewife Marjorie McWeeney w. broom amidst symbolic display of her week\u2019s housework at Bloomingdale\u2019s store incl. 35 beds to be made, 750 items of glass &amp; china, 400 pieces of silverware to wash, 174 lbs. of food to prepare, some of 250 pieces of laundry\/p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/08\/womans-dilema-chores.jpg?quality=85&w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/08\/womans-dilema-chores.jpg?quality=85&w=600\" src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/08\/womans-dilema-chores.jpg?w=300&#038;quality=85&#038;h=288\" alt=\"The American woman's dilemma in 1947 from LIFE magazine.\" height=\"288\"><\/noscript>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" style=\"max-width:300px\"><span class=\"credit\" >Nina Leen&mdash;The LIFE Picture Collection\/Getty Images<\/span><span class=\"caption\" ><b> <\/b>A week&#8217;s work for Marjorie McWeeney is assembled by Bloomingdale&#8217;s store. <\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Many more professional avenues are available to American women today than were in the past, but the basics of this 70-year-old story will still ring true for many. The full-time workers, at least those who could afford to have a choice in the matter, had to earn enough to cover childcare costs. Those who stayed home full-time were faced with an uncertain future if they planned to return to the workforce later, though by LIFE&#8217;s count U.S. housewives at that time contributed unpaid labor worth $34 billion ($378 billion today) to the economy each year.<\/p>\n<p>If they did not plan to return to work after their children were grown, they faced a life, in the magazine&#8217;s words, of being &#8220;bored stiff.&#8221; Part-time work was a partial solution, but it was hard to find and hardly feasible for those who actually needed the money they earned.<\/p>\n<div id=\"action_button_container\"><\/div>\n<p>And, as Frances Levison <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=mEgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA100#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">wrote<\/a> in an essay to accompany the story, all this analysis of the &#8220;dilemma&#8221; had an &#8220;inevitably disturbing effect&#8221; on the gender in question &mdash; serving as a reminder of one more kind of inequality faced by American women: the inequality of attention to what she was doing. &#8220;Probably no man has ever troubled to imagine,&#8221;

In the hours and days after the death of the Princess of Wales, mourners from all over the United Kingdom streamed to the gates of Buckingham Palace, to St. James&rsquo;s Palace, to Kensington Palace to lay bouquets in tribute to the woman known just as Diana. There were so many flowers &mdash; more than one million &mdash; that in descriptions, only metaphors from nature seemed to suffice: a sea of flowers, waves of them, a mountain. There were also poems, letters and teddy bears, and once the shock of Diana&rsquo;s death subsided, it took three days for London to remove the symbols of heartbreak. Prime Minister Tony Blair, in a now famous speech in the rain outside of his church, remembered the 36-year old princess for the nation.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;People everywhere, not just here in Britain, kept faith with Princess Diana. They liked her, they loved her, they regarded her as one of the people. She was the People&rsquo;s Princess and that is how she will stay, how she will remain in our hearts and our memories for ever.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>It has been 20 years since Diana&rsquo;s death but never has the legacy of this remarkable woman been more relevant for the House of Windsor. A family long defined by its chilly reserve is now praised for its candor (at least sometimes) and willingness to break with tradition (ditto). This year, Prince William and Prince Harry have begun to speak movingly about their emotional struggles in the wake of their mother&rsquo;s death. William took as his wife a commoner, Kate Middleton, the woman he loves, unlike his father, Prince Charles, who was compelled to marry out of duty to the crown. Diana&rsquo;s grandchildren, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, are being raised as part of the wider world, not sequestered from it. Even Queen Elizabeth, whose relationship with her daughter-in-law was famously strained, has shown signs of Diana&rsquo;s influence, in visits to AIDS clinics, a cause she reportedly discouraged Diana from supporting.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Na&iuml;ve, beautiful and sheltered, Diana could not have been a more unlikely agent of change for the British monarchy, the one to drag Buckingham Palace from the Victorian era into the 20th and 21st centuries. She was born in a home on one of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s country estates and raised in an ancient tradition that didn&rsquo;t ask scholarship of its females but instead put a premium on them being proper and respectable &mdash; attractive catches for aristocratic young men. As she grew up, Lady Diana Spencer met expectations, and on paper, was the perfect match for Charles, the heir to the British throne. Their fairytale nuptials on July 29, 1981, were dubbed, as the pages ahead reveal, &ldquo;The Wedding of the Century,&rdquo; and they enchanted the world. But we know now the marriage was doomed before it was started and that 20-year-old Diana was ill-equipped for a husband who did not love her. She foundered and struggled and withdrew &mdash; but then emerged &ldquo;The Mouse That Roared,&rdquo; as <em>Vanity Fair<\/em> memorably put it, discovering a reserve of strength as well as a common touch that the ruling family lacked.<\/p>\n<p>Diana learned to control the narrative and outshone her husband at every turn. She became both the fashionista with drop-dead backless dresses and the Good Mum running barefoot in the parents&rsquo; races during field days at her boys&rsquo; school. She could comfort a child whose leg had been lost to a land mine and hug an AIDS patient in an era when many, including the Windsors, feared such a gesture. Diana showed an intrinsic talent for connection, and she won the people&rsquo;s love even as she evolved into a global superstar. The Windsors however misread the whole story. If they had only perceived in Diana&rsquo;s public persona their new, best asset, rather than viewing her as a threat or an affront, they might have shared in the glow of her fame and charisma. Instead, they missed the point and missed their opportunity. Diana became the heroine, one who left an indelible imprint and won credit for modernizing an out-of-touch family.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<figure class=\"inline-inline_small alignleft \"><img src=\"https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/lazy-load\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/princess-diana-life-book-cover.jpg?w=190&#038;quality=85&#038;h=258\" data-attachment-id=\"4879166\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4879138\/diana-princess-remembered\/princess-diana-life-book-cover\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/princess-diana-life-book-cover.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1769,2405\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Princess Diana LIFE Books\" data-image-description data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/princess-diana-life-book-cover.jpg?quality=85&amp;w=221\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/princess-diana-life-book-cover.jpg?quality=85&amp;w=441\" alt=\"LIFE books, Diana a Princess Remembered.\" height=\"258\"><noscript><img data-attachment-id=\"4879166\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4879138\/diana-princess-remembered\/princess-diana-life-book-cover\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/princess-diana-life-book-cover.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1769,2405\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Princess Diana LIFE Books\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/princess-diana-life-book-cover.jpg?quality=85&w=221\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/princess-diana-life-book-cover.jpg?quality=85&w=441\" src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/princess-diana-life-book-cover.jpg?w=190&#038;quality=85&#038;h=258\" alt=\"LIFE books, Diana a Princess Remembered.\" height=\"258\"><\/noscript>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >Terence Donovan&mdash;Trunk Archive<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The shift was evident in the years after her death, but was crystalized for the public during the 2011 wedding of William and Catherine Middleton. Following the reception at Buckingham Palace, the prince whisked his bride away in a dark blue convertible from Aston Martin, makers of James Bond&rsquo;s favorite coupe. Thirty years earlier, Diana and Charles had been driven from the palace in an open-topped State Landau with footmen, like a scene out of Cinderella. Diana had always dreamed of being a princess. She had, as a girl, believed in fairy tales. But then as a woman, she rewrote the stories for her sons.<\/p>\n<p><em>Read more in the newly reissued LIFE special edition<\/em> Diana: A Princess Remembered,<em> available in the <a

He was a child of the Great War and lived thorough WWII and Vietnam &mdash; and every other conflict until Iraq and Syria. He followed these conflicts as an observer and a humanist,&#8221; Pledge told TIME. &#8220;When I look back at what he did with his career, war was his primary concern &mdash; it framed his understanding of humanity. Human enlightenment and understanding were always his goals.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In late 2016, as he celebrated his milestone birthday, we asked his friends and colleagues to reflect on his century. Here are those memories.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Russell Burrows, son of photojournalist Larry Burrows, with Barbara &#8220;Bobbie&#8221; Baker Burrows, a LIFE photo editor<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For three quarters of his life, John has had to share the anniversary of his birth with that day of infamy. It&#8217;s a concurrence mentioned in several tributes to John and, certainly, the 7th of December should never be forgotten. But that&#8217;s a rather grim connection.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s another day &mdash; famous too, and grim, but one that has ultimately come to be viewed much more positively &mdash; D-Day, that became central to John&#8217;s life. With the assignment of a team of great photographers to cover the invasion, and his own journey from wartime London to Normandy to Paris, John began a remarkable career. The stories that followed are oft-told and familiar to anyone with a knowledge of 20th century photography.<\/p>\n<p>Ten years younger than John, my father had been an office boy who eagerly became a photo lab technician in the LIFE London darkroom that was part of John&#8217;s domain. It was the beginning of what, through three generations, is now a long family friendship. (Who could have imagined that 60 years after those lab days, John would be accepting the Prix Nadar, for the photography book of the year, on my father&#8217;s behalf?)<\/p>\n<p>When Bobbi Baker joined LIFE in the 1960s, John was long gone from the magazine and well established as the picture editor of the New York <em>Times<\/em>. Just as illustrious, Richard O. Pollard was solidly in charge as LIFE&#8217;s director of photography. When Dick suggested that the <em>Times<\/em> had some photographs that LIFE needed and that &#8220;Johnny Morris over there&#8221; knew all about it, he told Bobbi to give him a call. The young photo researcher dutifully did so.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Johnny, we need those pictures.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before John made the delivery himself! Bobbi learned who John G. Morris was, and another connection was made between our families (she didn&#8217;t actually become a Burrows for a few more years).<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve known John, his wives, his family, we know John&#8217;s politics (and he will passionately share them with anyone), but in the U.S., in Britain and in France, we&#8217;ve seen his influence on photography &mdash; and few can match it. Happy century John.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"><img src=\"https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/lazy-load\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/12\/john-morris-birthday-100.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=85&#038;h=560\" data-attachment-id=\"4592518\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4592406\/john-g-morris-100\/john-morris-birthday-100\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/12\/john-morris-birthday-100.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1030,1030\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;DMC-LX2&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;John Morris at the Vanity Fair exhibit,\\rNational Portrait Gallery, London\\r11 February 2008\\rPhotograph by Russell Burrows&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1202748495&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Photograph by Russell Burrows&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.3&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.076923076923077&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"john-morris-birthday-100\" data-image-description=\"pJohn G.

Morris is this kind of guy you&#8217;re always impressed to meet. He had a friend called Robert Capa. Another called Henri Cartier-Bresson. So, like everybody else, I was really intimidated during our first meeting. But he is so generous, he tells you all of the stories you&#8217;ve always wanted to hear. He&#8217;s a living memory and such a good friend!<\/p>\n<p>I have had the privilege to have another friend, one year older than John: David Douglas Duncan. Both of them are proof that this photo field is a very good way to have a long life!<\/p>\n<p>One day, at a print auction for the French photographer Fran&ccedil;oise Demulder when she was sick, John put in one of his pictures. I bought it. A few years later, when he had his show in Perpignan, he signed it: &#8220;To my first customer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Robert Sullivan, editor of LIFE Books from 1990 to 2015<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In my years at LIFE in the 1990s and into this decade, I got to meet and, in certain cases, to know some legends: Eisie, Carl, David, Martha, Gordon, Harry, Henry, Bill and on. <span class=\"s1\">John&mdash;Loengard, who I still know, but also Morris&mdash;was a legend, but I never met him (the Morris, John); <\/span>But who could not be intrigued and inspired by John&rsquo;s career, success, and dedication? I learned from my colleague Bobbi, whom you&rsquo;ve heard from here, that he is the best kind of person. I heard that from others, too. I don&rsquo;t doubt it.<\/p>\n<p>As John turns 100, I couldn&rsquo;t be happier&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been rooting for John and David [Douglas Duncan] for a couple of years now&mdash;and I think the one thing I can say about John is, with LIFE, I always wanted to do away with the myths. People&mdash;those damned media people&mdash;always called wanting to know who kissed the nurse and how Capa&rsquo;s D-Day film distilled to so few images, among other things. I referred folks to Loudon&rsquo;s terrific book, or if pressed, said, &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Eisie didn&rsquo;t take notes, of course he didn&rsquo;t. A former nurse just died this year, in 2016, and got national obits as THE ONE in the photo. She may well have been. Or you could have been. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The sailor and the nurse were intended as universals, and they are best seen that way. Elise never said who was who, and surely Eisie never knew.<\/p>\n<p>John Morris was a young man working for us, which is to say LIFE and TIME Inc., in London when Capa&rsquo;s cobbled shipment arrived from the front lines in Normandy. I firmly believe that John developed capably what images could be capably developed. Everyone was in a hurry. There&rsquo;s no scandal here. We in the U.S. are in a season of scandal-mongering about every little thing, and I reflect that historically there are lots of &ldquo;scandals&rdquo; that have attached themselves to our&mdash;to LIFE&rsquo;s&mdash;story (again: go to Loudon&rsquo;s book for clarity).<\/p>\n<p>Yes the images look shaky, and that&rsquo;s part of their power. Was that a product of bombs on the beach or emulsions in London? If the latter, history&mdash;not to mention Mr. Spielberg&mdash;owes John Morris a greater debt. He took us there, not as much as Capa did, but he played his part.<\/p>\n<p>Happy birthday, John. I do hope we meet down the road.<\/p>\n<p><strong>John Loengard, a photographer and picture editor at LIFE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>John G. Morris is truly a gentleman. Our relationship over the years has been pleasant but only on brief and tangential meetings. I met him first when he was managing Magnum in the mid-1950s. His unwavering belief in the value of journalism by camera impressed me then, and that conviction is as fresh in him today as it was 60 years ago. Bravo! And happy 100th birthday!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Liz Ronk<\/strong> is the History Photo Editor for TIME and LIFE.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Olivier Laurent <\/strong>is the editor of TIME LightBox.

They had once followed Bette Davis into an elevator and had also been thrown out for trying to sneak into a party, which drove Bacall to announced that when <em>she<\/em> was famous, she would stay there.

While the photos survived, very little information remains about the people and places they show.<\/p>\n<p>Such situations are not uncommon when it comes to LIFE. Photographers like Kirkland were dispatched all around the world but, especially amid the fast-paced news climate of World War II, even the most striking photojournalism could be bumped out of the magazine by more pressing news. The staff did a generally excellent job of archiving the captions and reporters&#8217; notes that were sent back by the people who worked on the stories, but things fell through the cracks, and that incarnation of the magazine <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3503080\/the-best-of-life-37-years-in-pictures\/\">ceased<\/a> production in 1972. The images in the collection are still available and can be searched, but when they come back with sparse captions and no notes, today&#8217;s reporters are stuck. Sometimes outside clues can be used to identify the content of the images &mdash; last year, we even <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/4158994\/llama-kangaroo-party-photos\/\">identified a llama<\/a> &mdash; but not always.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>This Pittsburgh family appears to fall into that latter, unfortunate category. Kirkland died in 1979 and his 1954 memoir contains no mention of Pittsburgh.<\/p>\n<p>What we can say is that there would have been plenty of news to cover in Pittsburgh at the time. During the World War II era, the state of Pennsylvania was responsible for <a href=\"http:\/\/explorepahistory.com\/story.php?storyId=1-9-19&amp;chapter=3\" target=\"_blank\">nearly a third<\/a> of American steel production. With many citizens off to fight abroad, the need for workers was high. The year 1944 ought to have been a high point for steel workers: though the end of the war in 1945 would bring fear of <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=pd7yEHZ76TUC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=pittsburgh+1944+steel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXvu-31ZXVAhVLwiYKHVBzDWkQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=1944&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">scaled back<\/a> production and fewer jobs, the previous year saw high demand. (<a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=pd7yEHZ76TUC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=pittsburgh+1944+steel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXvu-31ZXVAhVLwiYKHVBzDWkQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=1944&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">Military contracts<\/a> were a source of much money.) Women as well as men went to work in the steel industry. But amid that boom, the steel industry felt the privations of war. In order to prevent inflation, the War Labor Board put a limit on raises, even as the cost of living increased.<\/p>\n<p>The terminology used in the extant captions (the &#8220;slum area&#8221; and the &#8220;dirty kitchen&#8221;) implies that these images were taken for a story about poverty, and perhaps this family was an example of the people who were affected by those limits on pay. We also know that Kirkland, who had a degree in social work administration and had <a href=\"http:\/\/articles.chicagotribune.com\/1989-09-22\/entertainment\/8901150389_1_dance-classes-charles-hull-life-magazine\" target=\"_blank\">worked in Chicago at the Hull-House<\/a> settlement prior to joining LIFE&#8217;s staff, was experienced in using his camera to capture the lives of the disadvantaged and marginalized.<\/p>\n<p>In the post-war years, <a href=\"time.com\/vault\/issue\/1949-10-03\/page\/13\/\">redevelopment<\/a> in Pittsburgh &mdash; home of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citylab.com\/design\/2012\/06\/what-pittsburgh-looked-when-it-decided-it-had-pollution-problem\/2185\/\" target=\"_blank\">infamously<\/a> bad air quality &mdash; led to the destruction of large areas of working-class housing (particularly African-American neighborhoods, apparently not visited by Kirkland).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For nearly a century and a half the metropolis had developed as an industrial slum,&#8221; LIFE noted in a <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=p0wEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22wallace+kirkland%22+pittsburgh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cw2xluS6db&amp;sig=LF-XiwJmeI3yYyF-A7YmckDCtJA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFvobb0pXVAhUB4yYKHSEiCFsQ6AEIQzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wallace%20kirkland%22%20pittsburgh&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">1<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=p0wEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22wallace+kirkland%22+pittsburgh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cw2xluS6db&amp;sig=LF-XiwJmeI3yYyF-A7YmckDCtJA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFvobb0pXVAhUB4yYKHSEiCFsQ6AEIQzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wallace%20kirkland%22%20pittsburgh&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">956 story<\/a> about efforts to rebuild the city. &#8220;Smothering under its black smoke shroud, it had been squalid, sooty and tired.

Our request: to photograph one of the elusive snipers. After much consultation Photographer Frank Dandridge, who is a Negro, was led through the streets to an abandoned tenement, up four flights of stairs and into a front room where he was allowed to take the picture of page 17 [seen in the third slide above].<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>For all of its emphasis on the role of snipers, the magazine&#8217;s reporting hinted at what we now know to be true: the fear of organized snipers among the rioters was unfounded. Indeed, the story accompanying Dandridge&#8217;s images noted that &#8220;it was puzzling why so few police and Guardsmen were hit&#8221; if such gunmen were really active in the area. And, when Dandridge was taken to a &#8220;clandestine meeting&#8221; on the &#8220;outskirts of the riot zone,&#8221; the men he met there told him that while they had given up on nonviolence as a concept, they were not in fact shooting at people. Instead, they used the sound of gunfire to influence where the police went during the rioting. &#8220;Five or six shots in the air are enough to draw cops thick as fleas on a dog,&#8221; one told the magazine.<\/p>\n<p>By 1968, those hints in LIFE were confirmed in the official <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncjrs.gov\/pdffiles1\/Digitization\/8073NCJRS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report<\/a> of the presidential commission appointed to investigate the matter. The policemen and Guardsmen present <em>believed<\/em> that they were under fire from snipers, the commission found, but after three hours of searching during which &#8220;four truckloads of National Guardsmen had arrived and troopers and policemen were again crouched everywhere looking for a sniper&#8221; the only actual gunshot came from law enforcement. And, the report continued, the belief that snipers were nearby led the Guardsmen and state troopers to direct &#8220;mass fire&#8221; at a housing project, killing several bystanders.<\/p>\n<p>The heavy emphasis on sniper fire in LIFE&#8217;s coverage of the events in Newark may not reflect an accurate retelling of what happened, but the story remains valuable for how it sheds light on the widely circulating misinformation of the time &mdash; and Dandridge&#8217;s photographs remain as stirring as ever.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"><img src=\"https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/lazy-load\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/newark-riot-1967-cover.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=85&#038;h=725\" data-attachment-id=\"4849032\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4848976\/newark-riots-1967-photographer\/life_july_28_1967-jpg\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/newark-riot-1967-cover.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1857,2405\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;BUD LEE&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;LIFE cover 7-28-1967: Newark: The Unpredicable Insurrection.

I thought, &#8216;Boy, is this one ever a flat tire.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>TIME Magazine, however, had a different take on the painting in<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/vault\/issue\/1963-12-27\/page\/44\/\"> a cover story <\/a>on Wyeth in 1963, calling the work, &ldquo;One of the most durable and disquieting images of 20th century America,&#8221; and explaining the story behind the picture:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The most famous of these [subjects] is a woman named Christina Olson. He has painted eight temperas of her or her house, a decrepit three-story clapboard pile atop a knoll near the Maine seacoast. One of them, <em>Christina&#8217;s World<\/em>, now 15 years old, is one of the most durable and disquieting images of 20th century America. Against the wall of landscape that leads up to her house, the crippled body of an ageless woman seems trapped, imprisoned by the very emptiness of the earth. Manhattan&#8217;s Museum of Modern Art, which hesitated before buying it in 1948 for $2,200, has repaid its investment 22 times over in the sale of reproductions.<\/p>\n<p>Christina, who is <span class=\"highlight\">crippled<\/span> <span class=\"highlight\">by<\/span> <span class=\"highlight\">polio<\/span>, is one of Wyeth&#8217;s few close friends. He judges people by their reactions to her. &#8220;I don&#8217;t take some people to see her,&#8221; says Wyeth, &#8220;because they won&#8217;t understand.&#8221; He fears that they will find her grotesque. Christina&#8217;s house contains the anonymous leavings of years of confinement. The smell of burning oil, charred wood, fat cats and old cloth fills the air. Christina, now nearing 70, does not let anyone see how she moves about, stubbornly refuses to use a wheelchair. &#8220;Andy&#8217;s a very good friend,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I like to pose for him. He talks a great deal when he paints, but he doesn&#8217;t talk nonsense.&#8221; She does not talk nonsense either. Despite her painful loneliness, she is dignified, proud and intelligent.<\/p>\n<p>None of Wyeth&#8217;s portraits of Christina look alike; the artist injects his own humanity into the people and places around him. More than anything else that Wyeth paints, Christina&#8217;s individuality and inner strength are a mirror-portrait of the artist himself. She is a touchstone of his compassion.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small alignright \"><img src=\"https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/lazy-load\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/andrew-wyeth-time-magazine-cover.jpg?w=280&#038;quality=85&#038;h=376\" data-attachment-id=\"4840048\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4840031\/andrew-wyeth-at-100-and-the-story-behind-his-most-famous-painting\/time-covers-the-60s-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/andrew-wyeth-time-magazine-cover.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1791,2405\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;TIME MAGAZINE, COPYRIGHT TIME IN&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;TIME cover 12-27-1963 Portrait of artist Andrew Wyeth done by his sister, Henriette Hurd.&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;-189820800&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;TIME MAGAZINE, COPYRIGHT TIME IN&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;TIME COVERS - THE 60S&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TIME Magazine Andrew Wyeth Cover\" data-image-description=\"pDec. 27, 1963 TIME magazine cover with painting of artist Andrew Wyeth by his sister Henriette Hurd.\/p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/andrew-wyeth-time-magazine-cover.jpg?quality=85&amp;w=223\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/andrew-wyeth-time-magazine-cover.jpg?quality=85&amp;w=447\" alt=\"Dec. 27, 1963 TIME magazine cover with painting of artist Andrew Wyeth by his sister Henriette Hurd.\" height=\"376\"><noscript><img data-attachment-id=\"4840048\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4840031\/andrew-wyeth-at-100-and-the-story-behind-his-most-famous-painting\/time-covers-the-60s-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/andrew-wyeth-time-magazine-cover.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1791,2405\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"TIME MAGAZINE, COPYRIGHT TIME IN\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"TIME cover 12-27-1963 Portrait of artist Andrew Wyeth done by his sister, Henriette Hurd.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"-189820800\",\"copyright\":\"TIME MAGAZINE, COPYRIGHT TIME IN\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"TIME COVERS - THE 60S\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"TIME Magazine Andrew Wyeth Cover\" data-image-description=\"pDec. 27, 1963 TIME magazine cover with painting of artist Andrew Wyeth by his sister Henriette Hurd.\/p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/andrew-wyeth-time-magazine-cover.jpg?quality=85&w=223\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/andrew-wyeth-time-magazine-cover.jpg?quality=85&w=447\" src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/andrew-wyeth-time-magazine-cover.jpg?w=280&#038;quality=85&#038;h=376\" alt=\"Dec. 27, 1963 TIME magazine cover with painting of artist Andrew Wyeth by his sister Henriette Hurd.\" height=\"376\"><\/noscript>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >TIME Magazine<\/span><span class=\"caption\" >Dec. 27, 1963 TIME magazine cover with painting of artist Andrew Wyeth by his sister Henriette Hurd. <\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>When it came to a portrait of Wyeth himself, however, TIME turned for its cover image to a different artist: his sister, Henriette Wyeth Hurd.

Trump <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4447586\/trump-coal-industry-energy\/\">promised<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-trump-climate-power-idUSKBN1770D8\" target=\"_blank\">end<\/a> what he described as an Obama-era &#8220;war on coal.&#8221; On the campaign trail and on Thursday he said that the rough conditions coal miners face would be turned around by a new era of American &ldquo;energy dominance.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone through eight years of hell,&rdquo; Trump <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4839884\/energy-dominance-energy-independence-donald-trump\/\">said<\/a>. But &ldquo;we have finally ended the war on coal.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But, despite the rhetoric, suffering in coal country is not a new phenomenon.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div>\n<p>Coal production has generally ramped up steadily since the conclusion of World War II, with an occasional downturn. But during the same time period the number of people employed by the industry has declined dramatically, as machines have replaced humans and engineers have invented more efficient ways to mine coal.<\/p>\n<p>Images <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=VkgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">published in LIFE Magazine in 1959<\/a> captured what to date remains the most precipitous sustained downturn for coal mining employment: the period between World War II and the early 1960s. During that time the number of coal employees fell from nearly 400,000 to less than 150,000 following the widespread adoption of new job-killing technology. Notes from the LIFE archive describe the coal loader &mdash; the most significant development leading to a decline in jobs at the time &mdash; as having &#8220;mechanical arms&#8221; that &#8220;resemble the action of the claws of a giant crab.&#8221; The machine could load 225 tons of coal in one hour, according to the notes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You have an industry that&rsquo;s very, very productive,&#8221; says William Gorby, a researcher at West Virginia University who studies Appalachian History, of mechanization. &#8220;But it&rsquo;s not employing that many people.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As LIFE highlighted at the time, programs did exist to help mine workers relocate from economically depressed regions, but they were often greeted by workers with reluctance &mdash; even though a tough life awaited those who stayed. In Beckley, W.V., a fifth of the county, or 10,000 people, received surplus food from a single distribution center, according to notes from the LIFE archive. Children often went to school malnourished.<\/p>\n<p>The coal industry continued to improve in productivity in the following decades as mechanization continued and mine companies began a practice called surface mining, which is more efficient and requires fewer employees.<\/p>\n<p>That reality&mdash; having been joined by a <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4570070\/donald-trump-coal-jobs\/\">slew of other pressures<\/a>, most significantly competition from cheap natural gas &mdash; continues to this day.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"><img

Though TIME <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/vault\/issue\/1967-05-05\/page\/36\/\">once remarked<\/a> that Canada had sometimes suffered from something of an identity crisis, defining itself more by what it isn&#8217;t than by what it is, certain elements of the Canadian character have long stood out.<\/p>\n<p>The stereotypical Northern woodsman captures one side of that national idea. And, back in 1953, photographer Wallace Kirkland explored that archetype for LIFE Magazine, with a photo profile of the perfectly named Rock Robertson &mdash; &#8220;Strong Man of the North,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=JUgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=strong%20man%20of%20the%20north&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q=strong%20man%20of%20the%20north&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">per the article&#8217;s headline.<\/a><br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Rock, at 31, six feet tall and 205 lbs., got his name from a grandfather who, in turn, acquired the nickname thanks to his strength. As a professional hunting and fishing guide, he regularly carried 300 pounds at a time for miles and could pull off a moose mating call good enough to draw in the bulls that hunters wanted most. He once went more than a week without food, thanks to a storm, before walking 48 miles in snowshoes to get out of the woods. He faced the forest with a smile and a shrug, embracing the outdoors lifestyle his ancestors &mdash; whether the French-Canadian, First Nations or Scottish ones &mdash; had likewise lived.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignleft \"><img src=\"https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/lazy-load\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/canada-man-13.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=85&#038;h=547\" data-attachment-id=\"4823982\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4823900\/canada-day-woodsman\/00983410-jpg\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/canada-man-13.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2095,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;WALLACE KIRKLAND&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;(L-R) Life photographer Wallace Kirkland &amp;

I built boxes out of plywood and mounted cameras inside of them,&#8221; Dominis explained. &#8220;John [Mbuthi, a local whom Dominis worked with on the story] and I worked for three weeks with them. We&rsquo;d go a mile ahead of a herd and put down the boxes and camouflage them. Then we&rsquo;d hide a quarter of a mile away and wait &mdash; maybe for several hours. Meanwhile the light might change and there was no way I could alter the exposure on the cameras. If the animal reached the boxes, I pushed the button that triggered the motorized cameras by a radio signal and ran off a whole roll of film. I must have exposed 40 rolls, but ended up with only one really good frame.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\t\t<form id=\"wpcom-iframe-form-85310f45c02430e52303a86628b00a55-59a93a3815f97\" target=\"wpcom-iframe-85310f45c02430e52303a86628b00a55-59a93a3815f97\" method=\"post\" action=\"\/\/wpcomwidgets.com\/?wpcom_origin=https%3A%2F%2Ftimedotcom.wordpress.com\" style=\"display: none\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"width\" value=\"100%\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"height\" value=\"569\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"frameborder\" value=\"0\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"style\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"class\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"scrolling\" value=\"no\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"mozallowfullscreen\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"resize\" value=\"0\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"replace_attributes\" value=\"1\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"fallback\" value=\"&lt;p class=&quot;protected-embed-fallback&quot;&gt;This embed is invalid&lt;\/p&gt;\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_data\" value=\"PGlmcmFtZSBoZWlnaHQ9IjU2OSIgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIHN0eWxlPSJkaXNwbGF5OiBibG9jayAhaW1wb3J0YW50OyBoZWlnaHQ6IDU2OXB4ICFpbXBvcnRhbnQ7ICIgc2Nyb2xsaW5nPSJubyIgZnJhbWVib3JkZXI9IjAiIHNyYz0iaHR0cDovL3JlbmRlcmVyLnFtZXJjZS5jb20vaW50ZXJhY3Rpb24vNThkOTk5MjI3N2Q4YTYwZTE4ZTA1YjBlP2NoYW5uZWxJZD01OGIwODRmZGE2OTdhMzBlMDBkNTA4MjAiIGNsYXNzPSIiIGFsbG93ZnVsbHNjcmVlbj0iIiByZXNpemU9IjAiIHJlcGxhY2VfYXR0cmlidXRlcz0iMSI+PC9pZnJhbWU+,e54c22ef8ac1eef597447aac97d7aa0f94893dd2\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_tag\" value=\"protected-iframe\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_hash\" value=\"85310f45c02430e52303a86628b00a55\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/form>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<iframe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname=\"wpcom-iframe-85310f45c02430e52303a86628b00a55-59a93a3815f97\"\n\t\t\tid=\"wpcom-iframe-85310f45c02430e52303a86628b00a55-59a93a3815f97\"\n\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"100%\" \t\t\theight=\"569\" \t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen\t\t\tclass=\"wpcom-protected-iframe \"\n\t\t><\/iframe>\n\t\t\n\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-85310f45c02430e52303a86628b00a55-59a93a3815f97');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-85310f45c02430e52303a86628b00a55-59a93a3815f97');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-85310f45c02430e52303a86628b00a55-59a93a3815f97'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '\/\/wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\/\/ Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\/\/ Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\/\/ Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); \/* compat for infinite scroll *\/ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'DOMContentLoaded', func, false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t<\/script>\n\t\t\n<p>Featured in this gallery are images provided by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cah.utexas.edu\/collections\/photojournalists\/intro.php\" target=\"_blank\">Briscoe Center for American History<\/a> at the University of Texas at Austin of these contraptions that John Dominis set up.

That long-running tension was the subject of <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=7E4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">a 1960 examination by LIFE magazine<\/a> on the 10th anniversary of the war&#8217;s onset, which captured one of the &#8220;endless series of small but meaningful disputes&#8221; along the North-South border in the photographs seen here.<\/p>\n<p>As the article explained, a demilitarized zone (DMZ) of 4,300 yards separated the Communist forces in the North from the U.N. forces in the South, with strict regulations governing what could be allowed inside the buffer area. In this particular instance, U.N. forces had noted &#8220;North Korean troops building a suspicious-looking concrete fortress inside the DMZ&#8221; and, after a meeting was called to discuss the matter, American representatives were asked to figure out what it was. The North Korean forces refused to allow inspection of the structure, going so far as to hold objects in front of the sight-lines of Americans&#8217; binoculars.<\/p>\n<p>After about an hour of &#8220;wrangling,&#8221; the photographer reported, the two sides went their separate ways, adding one more item to the list of &#8220;unresolved issues&#8221; at the border.<\/p>\n<p>Today, nearly seven decades after the DMZ was established, that infamous buffer zone still exists and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2016\/mar\/21\/north-korea-south-korea-dmz-landmines\"

Within a few years, she would have died in a concentration camp, but her diary survived. The following is an excerpt from LIFE&rsquo;s new special edition, <\/em><strong>Anne Frank: The Diary at 70, <\/strong><em>available in the <a href=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/2qphlXX\" target=\"_blank\">TIME Shop<\/a>, on <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2qF5vH6\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a><\/em><em> and at r<\/em><em>etailers everywhere.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>During the years of the Holocaust, the Nazis systematically murdered six million Jews, as well as five million Roma, Sinti, priests, nuns, people with disabilities, homosexuals, and political prisoners. The killing took place throughout Europe in more than 40,000 concentration, labor, prisoner of war, and internment camps, as well as by the <em>Einsatzgruppen, <\/em>mobile killing squads, which machine-gunned entire communities or shoved residents into gas-asphyxiation vans.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Some 80 percent of Dutch Jews died in the Holocaust, giving Holland the highest death rate in western Europe. Of the 107,000 Dutch Jews sent to the camps, only 5,000 lived. The death toll at Auschwitz, where more than a million people died, proved especially high. Of the 60,000 Dutch Jews shipped to Auschwitz, just 673 survived, including 127 men and women who had been on the Frank family&rsquo;s transport there in September of 1944.<\/p>\n<p>Otto Frank was one of them, having been spared because he had been placed in the sick barracks before the Russian army liberated the camp on January 27, 1945.<\/p>\n<p>When the nearly six foot tall Otto left Poland, he weighed less than 115 pounds. He knew that Edith had died, but he was determined to make his way back to Amsterdam. &ldquo;All my hope is the children,&rdquo; he wrote to his mother in Switzerland. &ldquo;I cling to the conviction that they are alive and that we will be together again.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video id=\"brightcove-player-4870846639001\" data-video-id=\"4870846639001\" data-account=\"293884104\" data-player=\"SJa0Thl7\" data-embed=\"default\" autoplay controls preload=\"auto\" class=\"video-js responsive-video\"><\/video><\/div>\n<p>Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl had kept the firm going during the war. Jo Kleiman, who was released from the Amerfoort concentration camp soon after his arrest because of his health, made it back to the firm too. Yet, as the war drew to an end and the Allies advanced, conditions throughout the Netherlands continued to deteriorate. Distribution of food and supplies was disrupted, and citizens chopped down trees and dismantled homes for fuel. Some resorted to eating tulip bulbs, and more than 20,000 Netherlanders starved to death during what became known as the Hunger Winter. &ldquo;All conversations centered on food,&rdquo; wrote Miep. &ldquo;Food obsessions were affecting all our minds.&rdquo; After Canadian troops liberated Amsterdam in May 1945, displaced residents staggered home. Victor Kugler, who escaped from the Nazis during a forced march, returned to work.<\/p>\n<p>Then on June 3, Otto Frank rang Miep and Jan Gies&rsquo;s doorbell.<\/p>\n<p>Miep would later recall how, after standing speechless for a time, Otto released the &ldquo;thunderbolt&rdquo; of news that Edith would not return but that he held out hope for his daughters.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pages.email.time.com\/newsletters\/?newsletter_name=HISTORY&amp;source=article-history\"><em>Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Otto moved in with the Gieses, went back to Opekta, and put ads in papers seeking information on Anne and Margot. Finally, in July, he heard that Jannie Brandes-Brilleslijper might know of their fate. On the 18th of that month, he went to her home.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I could hardly speak because it was very difficult to tell someone that his children were not alive anymore,&rdquo; Jannie recalled. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;They are no more.&rsquo; He turned deathly pale and slumped down into a chair.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>After the Red Cross confirmed their deaths, and Miep knew that Anne would not be coming back for the diary, she told Otto that she had kept it and 327 loose papers safe. Though he was at first too overwhelmed to read the testament his daughter had left of her short life, eventually he girded himself to learn what Anne had written. What he found, he would recall, was &ldquo;so unbelievably exciting&rdquo; that he could barely put it down.<\/p>\n<p>Not only the diary but also the revisions that Anne had made as she dreamed of creating a novel and launching her career had miraculously survived. &ldquo;This brilliant young girl revised her diary because she discovered that she had become a much better writer,&rdquo; the novelist Philip Roth, who conjured up Anne in his novels <em>The Ghost Writer, Exit Ghost, <\/em>and <em>My Life as a Man, <\/em>has observed. &ldquo;The fact that she rewrote it is one sign that, had she survived, she would have achieved an important literary career.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Otto reunited with old friends. Eva Schloss and her mother, Elfriede, survived Auschwitz. One day Otto came by with a small parcel under his arm and carefully took out Anne&rsquo;s diary. &ldquo;It was very emotional,&rdquo; Schloss tells LIFE. &ldquo;He read a few sentences but he always broke into tears.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>He had decided that it would be his mission to share Anne&rsquo;s words with the world. Otto had the diary typed up, though he shifted a few entries and omitted sections that were critical of her mother and of Fritz Pfeffer, as well as certain entries that included Anne&rsquo;s musings on her emerging sexuality. It proved difficult to find a publisher until one of Otto&rsquo;s friends showed it to the historian Jan Romein, who wrote a front-page article with the headline &ldquo;<em>Kinderstem<\/em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;A Child&rsquo;s Voice&rdquo;) for the April 3, 1946, edition of the newspaper <em>Het Parool. <\/em>&ldquo;To me, however, this apparently inconsequential diary by a child,&rdquo; Romein wrote, &ldquo;stammered out in a child&rsquo;s voice, embodies all the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence at Nuremberg put together.&rdquo; Soon after, the Amsterdam publisher Contact agreed to publish the book, and on June 25, 1947, it appeared as <em>Het Achterhuis <\/em>(<em>The Secret Annex<\/em>). Otto gave copies to family, friends, the Dutch prime minister, and the royal family. (Miep Gies could not bring herself to read it until the second edition appeared.)<\/p>\n<p>Only two years had passed since the end of the war, but for many the book by the 15-year-old who had written that she still believed that &ldquo;people are truly good at heart&rdquo; already proved useful as a way to personalize the Holocaust. &ldquo;Not only do you have a name and a face and a person in the case of Anne Frank, but you have a very well written diary. It is captivating,&rdquo; Professor Deborah Lipstadt, author of <em>Denying the Holocaust, <\/em>tells LIFE. &ldquo;She is a good writer and she knows how to express herself.

Over the course of a decade, until his death at age 36, he shot 491 stories for the magazine, including the 1960 Presidential campaign. At the Kennedy inauguration, he captured the iconic photograph of a beaming President with his glamorous wife, <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4581380\/jackie-movie-life-magazine\/\">a symbol of the Camelot mystique.<\/a><br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>During the magazine&#8217;s heyday, LIFE&#8217;s picture stories brought readers up close to unfolding events. For a photographer, an assignment was a passport to far-flung worlds and the front lines of history. Behind the scenes, Schutzer recorded the lives of leaders such as Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon and Kennedy, as well as Martin Luther King Jr. Describing her father&rsquo;s work, Schutzer&rsquo;s daughter Dena explains, &ldquo;He focused on the people in power <em>and<\/em> the powerless, the people who were responsible for the events and those who were affected by them.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-custom-size alignleft \"><img data-attachment-id=\"4796462\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4783803\/paul-schutzer-six-day-war-remembrance\/114684518-jpg\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/paul-schutzer-kennedy-six-day-war-41aa.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1242,1527\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"7.1\",\"credit\":\"PAUL SCHUTZER\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D80\",\"caption\":\"KENNEDY\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1243987200\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"60\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.003125\",\"title\":\"114684518.jpg\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"114684518.jpg\" data-image-description=\"<p>KENNEDY<\/p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/paul-schutzer-kennedy-six-day-war-41aa.jpg?quality=85&w=244\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/paul-schutzer-kennedy-six-day-war-41aa.jpg?quality=85&w=488\" class=\"wp-image-4796462\" src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/paul-schutzer-kennedy-six-day-war-41aa.jpg?w=244&quality=85&w=139\" alt=\"LIFE photographer Paul Schutzer.\" width=\"139\" height=\"171\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" style=\"max-width:139px\"><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>From tensions at the Berlin Wall, to life in the war-torn villages of Vietnam, to the fight for desegregation by men and women demanding basic civil rights, the stories Schutzer covered required him to take numerous risks. Before boarding a bus heading to the Jim Crow south, he once wrote to his wife Bernice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on the bus with the Freedom Riders. The magazine at first ordered me not to go, but the very reasons for not going, is the reason I must&#8230; This story should be told.&rdquo; He was working at a time of American greatness, Bernice now recounts. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t jaded or cynical.&rdquo; He wanted to connect and did so by getting close. He carefully edited his own work after each assignment, telling his wife that he would have been lucky to have taken even ten great photographs in a lifetime.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Schutzer traveled extensively through Eastern Europe, where he was deeply affected by what he saw at the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp. His family tells LIFE that, particularly as a Jewish person living and working in the post-war years, he was inspired by the spirit and promise of the new state of Israel. So it was no surprise that, with <a href=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/2qCNRCu\" target=\"_blank\">war looming there in 1967<\/a>, he was eager to be there. Determined, he prevailed on his friend Moshe Dayan, then Israel&#8217;s Minister of Defense, to embed with an assault unit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He didn&#8217;t intend to stay long, saying to his wife that he was finished with war. He was shot soon after. &#8220;One perhaps can console oneself that Paul died where he wanted to die and gave his life for what he felt most. And that is true,&#8221; LIFE <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=lVYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22paul+schutzer%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiokr6sipjUAhVE5iYKHSvlC-4Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22paul%20schutzer%22&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">eulogized<\/a> the next week. &#8220;But we have lost an exceptional, first-rate man &mdash; in Yiddish this type is called a <em>mensch<\/em>.

It was, as the introduction to that 1959 article noted, the toughest battle ever faced by a woman who had seen many &mdash; including literal battles in World War II, during which she served as<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4669481\/margaret-bourke-white-flying-fortress\/\"> the first woman accredited to cover the combat zones <\/a>as a photojournalist.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-medium alignleft \"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\" style=\"max-width:300px\"><span class=\"credit\" >Alfred Eisenstaedt&mdash;The LIFE Picture Collection\/Getty Images<\/span><span class=\"caption\" >LIFE photographers Alfred Eisenstaedt and Margaret Bourke-White in 1959.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>With photographs by her fellow LIFE photographer <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3491299\/unforgettable-eisenstaedt-22-amazing-photos-by-a-master\/\">Alfred Eisenstaedt<\/a>, some of which are seen above, the story offered up the personal reflections of the woman who had taken the image that appeared on the <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3764198\/lifes-first-ever-cover-story-building-the-fort-peck-dam-1936\/\">first-ever issue <\/a>of the magazine.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When I opened some medical insurance papers one day and learned I had Parkinson&#8217;s disease, the name did not frighten me because I did not know what in the world it was,&#8221; she wrote, describing how she learned the name that her doctors had kept from her as they prescribed physical therapy for her unlabeled symptoms. &#8220;Then slowly a memory came back, of a description Edward Steichen once gave at a photographers&#8217; meeting of the illness of Edward Weston, &#8216;dean of photographers,&#8217; who was a Parkinsonian. I remembered the break in Steichen&#8217;s voice: &#8216;A terrible disease&#8230; you can&#8217;t work because you can&#8217;t hold things&#8230; you grow stiffer each year until you are a walking prison&#8230; there is no known cure&#8230;'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The knowledge was, unsurprisingly, devastating to Bourke-White.<\/p>\n<p>But she set her mind to learn what she could, to look for anything she could do for relief. She learned, she wrote, that she was just one of three quarters of a million Americans with the disease &mdash; &#8220;often they appear to be struck down at their peak,&#8221; she wrote &mdash; and that, despite this number and the fact that the symptoms had been observed for thousands of years, nobody knew what caused it or how to stop it. Though Bourke-White was an extreme devotee of her exercise routine and even underwent a then-cutting-edge <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=nkgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA100#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">brain surgery <\/a>to &#8220;deaden permanently&#8221; part of her brain, she knew that the operation she&#8217;d received had only treated some of her disease and that there was no way to know how the symptoms would progress from there.<\/p>\n<p>Today, more than half a century later, as Parkinson&#8217;s researchers and advocates mark 200 years since Dr. James Parkinson <a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/essayonshakingpa00parkuoft\" target=\"_blank\">described<\/a> the disease (then known as &#8220;shaking palsy&#8221;) that would come to bear his name, many of the questions that confronted Bourke-White remain frustratingly unresolved for those who receive the same diagnosis she did. Treatment options, however, have advanced significantly since Bourke-White&#8217;s time &mdash; and new advances are offering the hope for something even better.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><video id=\"brightcove-player-5456371047001\" data-video-id=\"5456371047001\" data-account=\"293884104\" data-player=\"SJa0Thl7\" data-embed=\"default\" controls preload=\"auto\" class=\"video-js responsive-video\"><\/video><\/div>\n<p>For one thing, says Dr. Rachel Dolhun, vice president of medical communications at the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson&#8217;s Research, a person with Parkinson&#8217;s disease in the 1950s had no effective options for medication. The most widely prescribed therapy used today &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.parkinson.org\/understanding-parkinsons\/treatment\/Medications-for-Motor-Symptoms\/Carbidopa-levodopa\" target=\"_blank\">levodopa<\/a>, which temporarily addresses some Parkinson&#8217;s-related loss of dopamine, a movement-regulating brain chemical &mdash; wasn&#8217;t discovered until the late 1960s. It is now also understood in a way that it was not a few decades ago that many different brain chemicals and parts of the body are involved in symptoms linked to Parkinson&#8217;s, not just dopamine and the brain. In addition, the operation that Bourke-White received to basically destroy part of her brain is largely obsolete today, and a patient who was a candidate for brain surgery now would likely instead receive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.michaeljfox.org\/understanding-parkinsons\/living-with-pd\/topic.php?deep-brain-stimulation\" target=\"_blank\">deep brain stimulation<\/a>, which uses wires or electrodes to stimulate parts of the brain. (The physical therapy that was prescribed for Bourke-White, however, is one thing that hasn&#8217;t changed: exercise remains a key way to address symptoms.)<\/p>\n<p>And Dolhun says that advances in genetic science in the last 20 years or so, by offering new insights into how the disease works, have opened up a new range of research angles &mdash; and hope for a real cure, rather than just a better way to address the symptoms. For example, experts are excited by the testing of possible therapies that would target a protein called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pdf.org\/winter16_asynuclein\" target=\"_blank\">alpha-synuclein<\/a>. &ldquo;Right now, because of those understandings, the development pipeline is richer than it&rsquo;s ever been,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n<p>Technology is also changing what&#8217;s possible for researchers and scientists. The Michael J. Fox Foundation is running <a href=\"https:\/\/foxinsight.michaeljfox.org\/?utm_source=time-magazine&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_content=rachel-dolhun\" target=\"_blank\">an online clinical study<\/a> in which patients can log on and tell researchers about what it&rsquo;s like to live their experience of Parkinson&#8217;s disease, Dolhun says, and devices like wearables and smartphones are providing new ways to track and communicate about the symptoms. For example, whereas it used to be that a doctor might observe a patient&#8217;s tremor for 15 minutes at a time every couple of months, now an app or a watch can allow patients to log data that gives researchers a 24\/7 look at information about those symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>These new possibilities are particularly important when it comes to Parkinson&#8217;s disease, since the experience of what it&#8217;s like to live with and fight the symptoms is very individualized. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a different journey for every single person who&rsquo;s on it,&#8221; says Dolhun. &#8220;That&rsquo;s why we need the patient experience to inform us so much, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important for patients to be involved directly in research.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<div id=\"action_button_container\"><\/div>\n<p>That&#8217;s also one reason why the openness of people like Margaret Bourke-White mattered in 1959 and continues to matter today. There can still be a stigma attached to telling others that you are experiencing something that might make them see you as weak or in need of assistance. But if those who have it keep their experiences to themselves, it&#8217;s harder for researchers to make progress toward a cure &mdash; and harder for others with the diagnosis to feel that they&#8217;re not alone.<\/p>\n<p>For Bourke-White, as she described for LIFE&#8217;s readers, her fight against Parkinson&#8217;s was, to the fullest extent possible, a reminder to keep working and enjoying what her body could do for every second possible. Nowadays, she wrote in 1959 after the surgery that helped her do that longer than would otherwise have been possible, &#8220;my fingers are more and more often loading my cameras, changing their lenses, and turning their winding buttons as I practice the simple blessed business of living and working again.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to feel shy about sharing their stories,&#8221; Dolhun says. &#8220;For [Bourke-White] to share her story so publicly I think really speaks volumes. When we see people come forward with their story, it&rsquo;s not an uncommon thing for them to say, &#8216;I really wish I had shared it earlier.&#8217; They feel a burden lifted.&#8221;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"LIFE","slug":"life","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/life\/","description":"Classic Pictures From LIFE Magazine's Archives","life":true,"all_sections":["time-section-health","time-section-history","time-section-life"]},"tag":{"name":"health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/health\/"},"tags":"alfred eisenstaedt|health|Innovation Health|LIFE Magazine|margaret bourke-white|Parkinson\\'s Disease|photography","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=280","small_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=560","landscape_large":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=550&h=367&crop=1","large":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=550","large_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=1100","square":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=600&h=600&crop=1"},"credit":"Alfred Eisenstaedt\u2014The LIFE Picture Collection\/Getty Images","caption":"<b>Caption from LIFE.<\/b> Straining to relearn how to speak distinctly after disease had blurred and weakened her voice, the author, with another patient, is taught by therapists (rear) to exaggerate lip movements.","title":"Margaret Bourke-White Parkinson's Disease","alt":"Margaret Bourke-White's struggle with Parkinson's disease.","providers":[],"masonry":{"small_width":300,"small_height":212,"large_width":625,"large_height":442}},"hero_listing":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=280&h=187&crop=1","small_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=560&h=374&crop=1","landscape_large":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=550&h=367&crop=1","large":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=550&h=367&crop=1","large_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=1100&h=734&crop=1","square":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/bourke-white-parkinsons-disease-01.jpg?quality=85&w=600&h=600&crop=1"},"credit":"Alfred Eisenstaedt\u2014The LIFE Picture Collection\/Getty Images","caption":"<b>Caption from LIFE.<\/b> Straining to relearn how to speak distinctly after disease had blurred and weakened her voice, the author, with another patient, is taught by therapists (rear) to exaggerate lip movements.","title":"Margaret Bourke-White Parkinson's Disease","alt":"Margaret Bourke-White's struggle with Parkinson's disease.","providers":[],"masonry":{"small_width":300,"small_height":212,"large_width":625,"large_height":442}},"id":4794147,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F4794147%2Fparkinsons-disease-life-magazine%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F2qfZQdQ","encoded_title":"LIFE+Shared+This+Remarkable+Parkinson%E2%80%99s+Disease+Story+in+1959.+A+Lot+Has+Changed+Since+Then","gallery":{"id":4794147,"slug":"parkinsons-disease-life-magazine","title":"LIFE Shared This Remarkable Parkinson's Disease Story in 1959.

From his <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=5E0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">presidential victory in 1960<\/a> to the<a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=XFQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\"> trials of governing<\/a>, the events of his time demonstrated why LIFE and the JFK went together so well. Part celebrity report and part serious world news, the coverage captured the Kennedy magic.<\/p>\n<p>But only a little more than half of the times that JFK appeared as the featured image or story on the magazine&#8217;s cover during its <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3503080\/the-best-of-life-37-years-in-pictures\/\">37-year-run<\/a> took place during that Kennedy decade. (When his face appeared on additional covers throughout the magazine&#8217;s publication run, it was as an inset or part of collage.) The rest, starting with the <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=U1IEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">Nov. 29, 1963, issue<\/a>, were different. After Kennedy&#8217;s assassination, his legacy endured. He was, as pictured in a 1966 cover that focuses on his brother Robert&#8217;s career, an inescapable figure in the background of the political and cultural history that followed.<\/p>\n<p>On the 100th anniversary of his birth, more than half of that time has passed without JFK&#8217;s presence. And yet, as these images suggest, his influence has suffused a century.<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"LIFE","slug":"life","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/life\/","description":"Classic Pictures From LIFE Magazine's Archives","life":true,"all_sections":["time-section-history","time-section-life"]},"tag":{"name":"LIFE Magazine","slug":"life-magazine","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/life-magazine\/"},"tags":"John F.

Even during what swimming-pool expert Jeff Wiltse has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=90213675\" target=\"_blank\">described to NPR<\/a> as the &#8220;pool-building spree&#8221; of the 1920s and &#8217;30s, most of the pools being built were large, resort-style ones. Owning a private pool was so expensive and difficult that only the very wealthy could do so. That changed around 1960 &mdash; due to technology but also, as Wiltse <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=90213675\" target=\"_blank\">points<\/a> out, sometimes due to backlash to the desegregation of public pools.<\/p>\n<p>When LIFE magazine sent photographer Joe Scherschel to capture the new world of the backyard swimming pool in 1960, the magazine <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=U08EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA64#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">reported that<\/a> U.S. consumers were predicted to spend $250 million &mdash; that&#8217;s more than $2 billion of today&#8217;s dollars &mdash; on private pools. And, thanks to new innovations in pool building, the cost of a backyard pool was way down, so do-it-yourself fans and middle-class families could afford to add a pool to their property for far less than it would have cost before.<\/p>\n<p>But not everything was perfect in the pool, as LIFE pointed out: &#8220;Pool owners must cope with water filters, seasonal changes and sudden friends.&#8221;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"LIFE","slug":"life","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/life\/","description":"Classic Pictures From LIFE Magazine's
