the ballet company of the future\n#### Web Development &bull; System Design &bull; UX &bull; Branding\nBoston Ballet came to us to redesign their web presence to bring the ballet experience to life and encourage engagement. We built a user-friendly site that integrated a refreshed design language that put engaging content front and center.","article":"![BosBal CaseHero](\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F21KXmJgjIQKimgqcmU2Wu8\u002Fc7feab5115820f01a8e0479ce5a8afd4\u002FBosBal_CaseHero.png)\n\n### background\nThe Boston Ballet had an out of date digital presence that was difficult to navigate and transact and didn’t encourage exploration. With an outdated purchase path, multiple departments needing to be represented (most critically, the Box Office, Development, and School), and over 100 new features to implement, this build presented formidable technical challenges.\n \n### goal\nThe goal was to encourage web visitors, especially casual ticket buyers, to explore and make it easier for them to buy tickets and classes, as well as make donations. To create an identity and website designed to live on for many years and a strategy that would make rich and engaging content the centerpiece of the site.\n \n### strategy\nWe wanted to smartly move casual ticket buyers up the commitment pyramid. We determined a design aesthetic and language were needed that would bring to life four key pillars of the institution: Artistic Breadth, Uncompromising Excellence, Openness & Inclusion, and Youthful Energy.\n \n### execution\nThrough design explorations in collaboration with the client, we developed an aesthetic expressing emotion and movement while being direct and straightforward when information had to be surfaced quickly and easily understood.\n\nTo address the need for teams within the Boston Ballet (box office, school, fundraising) to have the ability to easily update information, we designed a modular system.\n\nIntegration with the pre-existing CRM was a top priority.  Multiple access points and streamlined connections to the purchase pathway gave people a consistent experience from the content side of the site to checkout.\n\n"}},"voteirl":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"mz9FpCOq3IUkMmSuEoIou","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-06-08T21:10:59.684Z","updatedAt":"2017-06-29T21:12:11.434Z","revision":9,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"work"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"heading":"getting out the vote","slug":"voteirl","isSplash":false,"showInIndex":true,"indexAsset":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"33LIOaE85Oi26muyCsYy2o","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-06-08T15:50:14.773Z","updatedAt":"2017-06-08T15:50:14.773Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"VoteIRL Index","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F33LIOaE85Oi26muyCsYy2o\u002F948c3c829e7ab4262699842f15a5a8d8\u002FVoteIRL_Index.png","details":{"size":1793137,"image":{"width":1500,"height":763}},"fileName":"VoteIRL_Index.png","contentType":"image\u002Fpng"}}},"order":3,"deviceHero":false,"overlay":true,"backgroundAsset":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"7hABUWtXMcE4WUe0oOo6oi","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-06-08T16:23:27.392Z","updatedAt":"2017-06-08T20:24:25.242Z","revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"voteirl","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fvideos.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F7hABUWtXMcE4WUe0oOo6oi\u002Fb7aa6189a7af36a29045ad9830ffd9f1\u002Fyoutube-__voteirl-slide.mp4","details":{"size":2175707},"fileName":"youtube-__voteirl-slide.mp4","contentType":"video\u002Fmp4"}}},"callToActionLabel":"see more","externalCallToActionLabel":"watch video","externalCallToActionLink":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=VpDpDF3oees","tagline":"Calling on the YouTube community to put down their phones & vote in real life.","color":"#ea4235","client":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"6ek5urQlEIcMuIkc8k0kaS","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-02-13T17:07:31.997Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-23T21:32:21.974Z","revision":9,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"client"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"YouTube","logo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"6DHO5M6xLUgG6ymKKUCuoW","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-02-13T17:07:23.638Z","updatedAt":"2017-02-13T17:07:23.638Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"YouTube White","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F6DHO5M6xLUgG6ymKKUCuoW\u002F82ec4244c2a21099da725aa1b6503ad0\u002Fclientlogo_youtube_w.svg","details":{"size":2521,"image":{"width":501,"height":209}},"fileName":"clientlogo_youtube_w.svg","contentType":"image\u002Fsvg+xml"}}},"alternativeLogo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"GfQGS4nE6AUqqIqmW4SsW","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-02-13T17:07:02.583Z","updatedAt":"2017-02-13T17:07:02.583Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"YouTube Slate","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002FGfQGS4nE6AUqqIqmW4SsW\u002F87b5d7f47722ef5920aa6657ef0fe6bb\u002Fclientlogo_youtube_s.svg","details":{"size":2524,"image":{"width":501,"height":209}},"fileName":"clientlogo_youtube_s.svg","contentType":"image\u002Fsvg+xml"}}},"clientRackLogo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"4oAbJX5VK8Gaww48gk2Cis","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-02-27T17:55:23.371Z","updatedAt":"2017-02-27T17:55:23.371Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"clientlogo all s Youtube","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F4oAbJX5VK8Gaww48gk2Cis\u002Fe4c425ee4e72b4a255bfb8a2735a2d11\u002Fclientlogo_all_s_Youtube.svg","details":{"size":2314,"image":{"width":93,"height":57}},"fileName":"clientlogo_all_s_Youtube.svg","contentType":"image\u002Fsvg+xml"}}},"clientRackLogoWhite":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"5reZ8XRqneAIqQO8KgA64M","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-03-30T20:02:21.486Z","updatedAt":"2017-03-30T20:02:21.486Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"clientlogo all w Youtube","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F5reZ8XRqneAIqQO8KgA64M\u002F1dc70a63e39708f9b4e0452c56399c23\u002Fclientlogo_all_w_Youtube.svg","details":{"size":2311,"image":{"width":93,"height":57}},"fileName":"clientlogo_all_w_Youtube.svg","contentType":"image\u002Fsvg+xml"}}},"featured":true,"clientRackOrder":2}},"services":["Strategy","Design","Technology","Analytics"],"articleHeading":"## vote in real life\n#### FILM &bull; SOCIAL CONTENT &bull; CONTENT STRATEGY &bull; INFLUENCERS\nThe YouTube community is famous for organizing movements. And yet, despite this digital activism, they’re the least likely demographic to vote in a presidential election. In 2016, we set out to change that in one minute and thirty four seconds.","article":"#### Case Study: #VoteIRL\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fplayer.vimeo.com\u002Fvideo\u002F196485324\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\n\n### background\nKnowing that the US Presidential Election would be a major cultural moment in 2016 and that voter turnout had decreased to abysmal levels. YouTube wanted to help spark change and empower the voices of YouTubers & celebrities, along with the millennials who follow them.\n \nYouTube’s objective was to increase the levels of new voter registration and election day turnout for the 2016 election. We aimed to reach 50% of U.S. millennials.\n\n - Only 1 in 3 millennials voted in 2012.\n - In 2016, 50% of unregistered voters were millennials.\n - 2016 is the first election where millennials will outnumber baby boomers.\n\n### strategy\nTo define YouTube’s unique role in driving young voter turnout, we looked for insights in three key areas: the YouTube community, the elections landscape, and cultural trends. We saw that there were already YouTubers, with thousands to millions of young fans, who deeply cared about the elections. Given the increasingly negative tone of the elections season, we saw an opportunity to empower those YouTubers and use them as catalysts to spark turnout in a positive way.\n \nThrough social listening we found a +34% MoM increase in negativity & voter fatigue in months before election, creating an opportunity for a more lighthearted voting message. Along with that, adding a social challenge call-to-action, we could create a sense of urgency and action.\n \nUtilizing influential YouTubers and celebrities we developed a light-hearted, challenge-oriented message during two key moments: National Registration Day and Election Day to create a movement that socialized the vote.\n\n### results\nOver 211 unique videos were created by top YouTubers and celebrities, including the Rock, Cher, Ryan Seacrest, Conan O’Brien, The Chainsmokers and more. The results of which were over 11 million combined views and over 1.7 billion impressions."}},"doesnt-take-a-genius":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"13wXlnZaZ2MeAsgoyGyk26","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-03-21T19:44:20.651Z","updatedAt":"2017-06-29T21:10:55.351Z","revision":13,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"work"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"heading":"doesn’t take a genius","slug":"doesnt-take-a-genius","isSplash":false,"showInIndex":true,"indexAsset":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"2GZwUOzckgUC6U6ss8Suic","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-03-23T14:57:08.820Z","updatedAt":"2017-06-05T23:28:20.374Z","revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"SSGENIUS_Index","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F2GZwUOzckgUC6U6ss8Suic\u002F2d808a190d7f8a5f3f709cc0399290a3\u002Fsamsung_genius2_F48C8140-3A24-11E4-949C02642CF0EA2B.jpg","details":{"size":30104,"image":{"width":630,"height":369}},"fileName":"samsung_genius2_F48C8140-3A24-11E4-949C02642CF0EA2B.jpg","contentType":"image\u002Fjpeg"}}},"order":12,"deviceHero":false,"overlay":false,"color":"#3582EA","client":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"1vT1JLUH60uQSqQOccKkSM","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2016-11-01T17:27:22.275Z","updatedAt":"2017-03-30T20:10:27.321Z","revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"client"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Samsung Mobile","logo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"JjJhfUWoQSqWaAM6asmIi","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2016-11-08T22:17:36.464Z","updatedAt":"2016-11-08T22:17:36.464Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"samsung_white","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fassets.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002FJjJhfUWoQSqWaAM6asmIi\u002F3c23b28e44550b7268156a325677831a\u002Fsamsung_white.svg","details":{"size":4867},"fileName":"samsung_white.svg","contentType":"image\u002Fsvg+xml"}}},"alternativeLogo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"5aL2KRrBrUsgwW4sWG2oUO","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2016-11-08T22:17:32.314Z","updatedAt":"2016-11-08T22:17:32.314Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"samsung_slate","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fassets.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F5aL2KRrBrUsgwW4sWG2oUO\u002Fea8d90c9e61b04942d6ab74893807866\u002Fsamsung_slate.svg","details":{"size":4684},"fileName":"samsung_slate.svg","contentType":"image\u002Fsvg+xml"}}},"clientRackLogoWhite":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"OiuXCPJBYsY48YKgQkAwC","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-03-30T20:06:53.857Z","updatedAt":"2017-03-30T20:06:53.857Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"clientlogo all w Samsung","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002FOiuXCPJBYsY48YKgQkAwC\u002F5103413f1b288e0c6a5e46f3e1cf925d\u002Fclientlogo_all_w_Samsung.svg","details":{"size":2379,"image":{"width":93,"height":57}},"fileName":"clientlogo_all_w_Samsung.svg","contentType":"image\u002Fsvg+xml"}}},"featured":false}},"services":["Strategy","Design","Social","Analytics","Production"],"articleHeading":"## stealing thunder\n#### BRAND STRATEGY &bull; CONTENT STRATEGY &bull; WEB VIDEO &bull; SOCIAL STRATEGY\nSamsung created the Phablet category back in 2011 when it launched its GALAXY Note phone and since then has gone on to dominate the lucrative large-screen phone category. On September 6th, 2014 that was about to change with the launch of one of the world’s most anticipated phones, a direct challenge to Samsung’s market position.","article":"\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fplayer.vimeo.com\u002Fvideo\u002F117678188\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\n\n\n### background\nSamsung Mobile came to Big Spaceship, as their global social media agency, to spoil the launch – a product being heralded as a ‘great step forward’ but would in fact be duplicating much of the innovation that Samsung had pioneered three years earlier. Competitive advertising is fraught with danger at all times, but when you are taking shots at the world’s biggest brand (by MARCAP) around their highly anticipated launch events you better get it right.\n\n### execution\nSo we got to work. We built a set of a faux back room where in-store mobile repairs are made, cast our actors, setup the Brooklyn war room where the core team maintained communication with the film studio a few miles away and the client in Seoul, a few thousand miles away.\n\nWe used intense social listening in the launch lead-up to help identify the persistent rumours about what the fanboy community was expecting to see from the new device and how they might be disappointed. We needed to find a way to get press coverage around the timing of the event that would deflate the buzz and show consumers that the new phone was not as innovative as its competitor’s marketing made it seem.\nOn September 6th, the day of the competitor’s big launch, we spent the entire day shooting videos in direct response to the presentation. The event started in an unexpected way. The live stream was only showing a graphic for the TV truck schedule and the audio was of a Chinese interpreter. Within 24 hours we pushed out six videos penned, “It Doesn’t Take a Genius” showing fanboy dismay at the “groundbreaking” large screen claims and taking digs at the competitor’s faltering live stream.\n\nAfter the videos went viral, we continued the campaign with shareable reaction GIFs taken from the videos. Collaborating with our client over a 13 hour time difference, using social media listening to dive deep into fanboy behaviors and executing a real time video campaign that made the world’s press take note, we showed that ‘It Doesn’t Take a Genius’ to see the GALAXY Note 4 is the real innovator. The press, fans and client all agreed that we successfully took a bite out of the competition. \n\n### results\nThis resulted in 14 million (approx. population of Chicago) video views, coverage in more than 60 global news outlets, a reach of 300 million (approx. population of USA) and extremely positive sentiment for competitive advertising."}},"big-spaceship":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"6ct9eks70AUcaKwsOemSg4","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-03-20T18:58:09.891Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-18T15:25:17.340Z","revision":21,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"work"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"heading":"A modern partner to ambitious brands","slug":"big-spaceship","isSplash":true,"showInIndex":false,"order":1,"deviceHero":false,"overlay":false,"backgroundAsset":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"688GKaR6WQgmuyoOGoaOcQ","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-08-18T15:25:12.905Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-18T15:25:12.905Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"BSSCOM SplashSlate","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F688GKaR6WQgmuyoOGoaOcQ\u002F90c6c09b1fd4495a2450115a213c0f86\u002FBSSCOM_SplashSlate.jpg","details":{"size":156491,"image":{"width":4800,"height":2700}},"fileName":"BSSCOM_SplashSlate.jpg","contentType":"image\u002Fjpeg"}}},"color":"#ffffff","client":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"SNpsmON7Gu6eICaqc2Eas","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2016-11-08T22:15:56.821Z","updatedAt":"2016-12-01T17:01:49.958Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"client"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Big Spaceship","logo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"1HFrWbnhs4g2KKokW8oqy2","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2016-11-08T22:17:26.599Z","updatedAt":"2016-11-08T22:17:26.599Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"big-spaceship_white","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fassets.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F1HFrWbnhs4g2KKokW8oqy2\u002F5be2e9c463ac275c2db09adf982ba304\u002Fbig-spaceship_white.svg","details":{"size":3587},"fileName":"big-spaceship_white.svg","contentType":"image\u002Fsvg+xml"}}},"alternativeLogo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"4lK7Fd5Y00O4IcOGgskCck","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2016-11-08T22:17:20.130Z","updatedAt":"2016-11-08T22:17:20.130Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"big-spaceship_slate","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fassets.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F4lK7Fd5Y00O4IcOGgskCck\u002Ff7a94b131cc8ee9c7b9885acbe9ffab0\u002Fbig-spaceship_slate.svg","details":{"size":3587},"fileName":"big-spaceship_slate.svg","contentType":"image\u002Fsvg+xml"}}},"featured":false}},"articleHeading":"We help organizations connect with audiences through a deep understanding of culture and behavior."}},"best-seat":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"7BMrA3mHIIOGUsiayc4Cmg","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2016-11-08T20:29:32.387Z","updatedAt":"2017-06-29T21:11:05.433Z","revision":53,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"work"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"heading":"best seat in the house","slug":"best-seat","isSplash":false,"showInIndex":true,"indexAsset":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"49tNBPICNiSseKScccCMQk","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2016-11-08T22:18:42.807Z","updatedAt":"2017-06-05T23:26:53.333Z","revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"IFC_HomePage","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F49tNBPICNiSseKScccCMQk\u002F2248ddedf389836b2e51136038eafc42\u002F05.jpg","details":{"size":556659,"image":{"width":1680,"height":1050}},"fileName":"05.jpg","contentType":"image\u002Fjpeg"}}},"order":11,"deviceHero":true,"overlay":true,"backgroundAsset":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8ify6rodzca5"}},"id":"Pybuo6lciYECEieOOYGQs","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-04-03T18:34:21.546Z","updatedAt":"2017-04-03T18:34:21.546Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"IFC_HEROslim","file":{"url":"\u002F\u002Fvideos.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002FPybuo6lciYECEieOOYGQs\u002F9d4215a1908c499f3e8a4fa7ddea455f\u002Fslim_ifc__1_.mp4","details":{"size":3393932},"fileName":"slim_ifc (1).mp4","contentType":"video\u002Fmp4"}}},"callToActionLabel":"See more","externalCallToActionLabel":"Visit The Site","externalCallToActionLink":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.ifcfilms.com\u002F","tagline":"Bringing the big screen to every screen.

Finding efficiencies meant that teams were setting up or breaking down one shoot, while the other was happening. \n \n### results\nThe digital video was one of the best performing Oikos had ever had and crossed over into broadcast.

definitive american history\n#### BRAND STRATEGY &bull; CONTENT STRATEGY &bull; WEB APPLICATION &bull; PRODUCT STRATEGY\nKen Burns is America’s definitive documentarian, and we joined forces to bring his work to the digital realm. Drawing on his entire 25-film oeuvre, it provides an experience that could only happen on an iPad.

I’ve never had a digital destination that allowed people to see the work in a different way.”—Ken Burns\n \nWe also had an internal goal: we wanted to show the rest of the film community how a touch device can deepen an audience’s relationship with a film.\n\n\n![KenBurns Sketch](\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F7bYqn4IsQ8EK02EuKaeKMi\u002Fba675924e3bce18304f1a29eaacc8977\u002FKenBurns_Sketch.jpg)\n\n### strategy\nOur research showed that while there are no shortage of apps with dense educational and historical information, they felt out of place on the iPad.

Ken plans to release one film every year for the next several years, so we built the app to allow for the addition of additional clips into existing playlists or the creation of new playlists.\n \nThe app provides multiple ways to navigate the content while remaining ruthlessly simple. The timeline is front and center, showing the broad scope of the app at a glance. Films are clearly labeled and collected along the bottom, while themes reside at the top. \n \nFor a product as tactile and immersive as Ken Burns, there was no substitute for testing early and often. We coded one interaction at a time to see how many clips could fit on the screen and remain legible and tappable. \n \nIn designing the UI, we focused on encouraging exploration, exploring dozens of options for representing related clips, finally settling on a unique set of intuitive gestures that made the user-experience interesting. \n \nTo launch the app, Ken Burns appeared at the SoHo Apple store to discuss the app with Stephen Colbert (watch the conversation here). We also helped Ken Burns do his first ‘Ask Me Anything’ Q&A on Reddit.

We used that insight to drive a communications strategy based on jargon free, infotainment to get across the S7’s, GearVR and Gear360 many features.\n \n### execution\nWe developed a three part lifestyle narrative that took viewers on a journey, helping them understand not only the product features, but also inspiring them to create their own adventures out in the world.\n \nOur interconnected story followed a group of millennials on a road trip to the White Sands National Monument, facilitated and captured by the entire Samsung product line.\nWe shot for eight days on location in L.A. and in the White Sands National monument in the New Mexican dessert. Our unorthodox narrative approach to the traditional “how to” video was balanced with\npainstaking attention to detail in our product footage, including capture of multiple UX flows to showcase the phone’s new functionality.\n \nDuring the shoot we also captured supplemental assets that were pushed out on Samsung’s social channels to increase engagement and reach. These 22 extra pieces of content were a series of GIFs, still photos, cinemagraphs and short video clips that were created exclusively on the entire suite of Samsung products.\n \n### results\nOur

at work at home\n#### BRAND STRATEGY &bull; PRODUCT STRATEGY &bull; WEB APPLICATION &bull; USER EXPERIENCE\nAs Chobani’s digital agency of record, we provided solutions for a wide variety of business challenges. In 2012, we embarked on our biggest challenge yet: helping the brand maintain its culture of friendliness and transparency as it quickly grew from a startup to nearly 3,000 employees.","article":"\u003Ciframe src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fplayer.vimeo.com\u002Fvideo\u002F85972098\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\n\n### background\nJust a few years ago, Chobani was a small yogurt startup. Back in those days, founder Hamdi Ulukaya would often spend time at the upstate New York factory, working on the floor and offering words of inspiration to his small but dedicated team. It was easy—his office was right there. Since then, the company has grown into a billion-dollar organization with employees on three continents. They were proud to see the world enjoying their yogurt, but they missed the informal, open communication of the old days.\n\n![Chobani Home 001](\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F7acKo9s0eIWEak40aSqO0M\u002F72deeb80287a06c8ed5a6082093eeb3a\u002FChobani_Home_001.png)\n\nWe knew how much Hamdi wanted to avoid the trap of bland, uninspiring communication many growing companies fall into. We also know a thing or two about maintaining connections in the workplace, so Chobani asked us for help.\n\nChobani Home was truly a cross-department project, including leaders from Chobani’s IT, HR, marketing and communications teams.\n\n\u003E Home allows the entire workforce—from factory to board room—to collaborate and share essential information about the company.\n\nWe began by isolating three specific goals. First, we needed to give Chobani leadership an intimate, immediate way to communicate—with the whole company or a targeted few. Second, we needed to provide all Chobani employees with a personal tool for exploring their rapidly evolving company. Finally, we aimed to cut down on email and encourage real-time social communication across the entire workforce. The output was a one-of-a-kind platform allowing the entire workforce—from factory to board room—to connect, collaborate and share immediate, essential information about the company.\n\n##### Here’s how we did it.\n### learn to behave like your audience\nEighty percent of Chobani employees don’t work at a desk. They’re on their feet in the factory, or in trucks transporting yogurt around the country, or in the lab developing new products and flavors. These were our users and we needed to learn everything about them; we couldn’t just rely on corner office “stakeholder interviews.”\n\n\u003E We embedded a research team at the plant in Norwich, NY and distributed over 1,600 paper surveys to production teams around the world.\n\nWe embedded a research team at the plant in Norwich, NY and distributed over 1,600 physical surveys to production teams around the world. We reviewed onboarding materials and interviewed dozens of workers to map employee experiences. We were thrilled to learn how remarkably tech-savvy the Chobani workforce is. Most of them have smartphones and use social media every day. This directly influenced our decision to create a cutting-edge mobile platform.\n\n![Chobani Home 005](\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F3b0IMfb8MgmQqyWAsKcqc2\u002F5301cd02aa9f640de420e903cd2b10d9\u002FChobani_Home_005.png)\n![Chobani Home 003](\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F58nPM9FXXOue2ycIi8WAam\u002F4b5b69a1d816d3a4d98a7bf5d45d593c\u002FChobani_Home_003.png)\n\n### review prototypes, not comps\nWe know a cycle of flat design reviews can be a disaster in terms of both effectiveness and timing. For this project it made sense to forgo the comps and build an interactive prototype right out of the gate. Instead of time-consuming meetings and PSD revisions, we made constant updates to the prototype, and everyone felt more confident making decisions based on something they could use and not just observe. Our friends at Chobani had something they could test out on their own time and show to colleagues for validation.\n\n\u003E For each cycle, we went from whiteboard to prototype in about three days.\n\nBefore touching any screens, we started by creating an interaction system and UI style guide. This gave an abstract sense of what the experience would feel like, including visual elements like colors, buttons and typography, as well as interaction patterns and design principles. Every decision was intentional, and having these elements established up front allowed us to quickly translate a new idea from sketch to prototype.\n\n![Chobani Image 02](\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F3cx8ajQl3WMkSAW2SoYkY2\u002F1675b396b27869ae14ac9132726d2cb0\u002FChobani_Image_02.png)\n\nTo determine the information architecture and content specifications, we held several rapid sketching sessions with the designers and front-end and back-end developers in the room together. This required a high level of trust between client and agency, but we kept the team small and moved fast. For each cycle, we went from whiteboard to prototype in about three days.\n\n### perfecting a small set of core features\nThanks to our extensive research and collaborative workflow, we quickly identified which features would satisfy both business needs and user needs. We built the product to prioritize these elements, but left enough flexibility for future growth and iteration. Below, we’ve highlighted a few of the most significant features.\n\n##### CUSTOMIZE THE NEWS FEED\nNot everyone needs (or wants) to see every single company update. We designed the news feed so leadership could choose how to target their posts: to the whole company or just a specific department or location. This protects employees’ time by only displaying relevant posts. At the same time, it encourages them to explore and discover what’s going on in other Chobani locations or departments—but only when they want to.\n\n![Chobani Home News](\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F12KMQ77Yw4msOoqaywIWay\u002F807ae1b825e474a3cc78e1afe7517818\u002FChobani_Home_News.png)\n\n##### SEARCH FOR ANYTHING\nChobani Home’s robust search functionality makes it easy for users find anything they’re looking for, from a colleague’s email address to a news post from last month.  Anyone can find anyone else in the company, along with their photo, location and contact info (and favorite Chobani flavor, of course).\n\n![Chobani Home Search1](\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F7JLmLeVfd6UiI6kYQqmmQK\u002Fcb06a349fa4f7a18fac09bb2f43b390d\u002FChobani_Home_Search1.png)\n\n##### PUBLISH WITH EASE\nTo create the publishing interface, we worked with several Chobani departments to determine what categorization labels would be most useful. Many were simple improvements on communication methods Chobani was already using (like paper newsletters and email blasts). We drew inspiration from behaviors on Tumblr, one of the simplest publishing platforms available. We built a fully customized publishing system so the team at Chobani doesn’t need to use a complicated back-end CMS to post a message. All they need to do is sign in and click the “New Post” button.\n\n![Chobani Home Publish](\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F58rZT1KFn2G4OYMCkkkYOs\u002Fdaf3a1797a98f282959218cc71d5cd0b\u002FChobani_Home_Publish.png)\n\n### create the anti-org-chart\nOne of our big goals was finding a way to show relationships between individuals and departments, even if those people weren’t in the same office and may have never met. Sounds like an org chart, right? We knew that wouldn’t work, because Chobani doesn’t have a traditional siloed organizational structure. It’s an organic ecosystem with various interconnected teams and processes. So we created an organization map and rolled it out to the entire company. It makes every employee feel like a human with a face, a location and a role in Chobani’s larger story.\n\n### built for modern browsers\nOur research proved the need to take a mobile-first development approach (duh). To get more specific, we had a conversation with our Chobani partners and confidently agreed we didn’t want to build for archaic browsers. Chobani is a technology-forward company, and we decided it would be better to encourage employees to update old browsers rather than support IE 8 or below.\n\n\u003E100% of the content is accessible and elegant from anywhere.\n\nAs a result, Chobani Home delivers a fast, flawless and contemporary experience. Mobile users don’t see a bare-bones version of the desktop: 100% of the content is accessible and elegant from anywhere. This was crucial to delivering our promise of clear, comprehensive, and transparent communication to all Chobani employees.\n\n### safe and current\nChobani has employees in ten locations and four countries. International regulations of collecting and classifying employee data aren’t easy, but we knew it was essential that all employees enjoy the same user experience. We worked with Chobani’s IT department to protect sensitive information while still providing an easily-updated CMS that will safely scale with Chobani’s growing global workforce. Once a day the system checks for new hires and deactivated accounts. Whenever a new employee joins the company, they are immediately given a profile and the ability to see what’s going on—whether it’s around the corner or in Amsterdam. Chobani uses a Microsoft tech stack, so we built a seamless integration between Chobani Home, ADP and the rest of their existing services.\n\n![Chobani Home Statistics](\u002F\u002Fimages.contentful.com\u002F8ify6rodzca5\u002F50FiFIN2UocOcCqoQYMIui\u002F111aaec80580572f659299371701a5ac\u002FChobani_Home_Statistics.png)"}}},"length":14},"people":{"core":[],"crew":[],"length":0,"bioExpanded":false,"bio":[]},"clients":{"items":[],"length":0},"staticPages":{},"header":{"heading":"our work","active":false,"color":"#393F42","foreground":"#393F42","logo":"","alternativeLogo":"","visible":false,"delta":200,"callToAction":{"link":"","label":"","back":false}},"disciplines":{"items":{}},"route":{"name":"404","path":"\u002Frobots.txt","hash":"","query":{},"params":{"0":"\u002Frobots.txt"},"fullPath":"\u002Frobots.txt","meta":{},"from":{"name":null,"path":"\u002F","hash":"","query":{},"params":{},"fullPath":"\u002F","meta":{}}}}</script><script src="/dist/manifest.108c7fd6b44543fcbc14.js" defer></script><script src="/dist/vendor.2c63f5c1a1e40dc09efb.js" defer></script><script src="/dist/app.6769a65067d878b233a8.js" defer></script>
