        The phpguru.org website was a website that was the personal blog of
        Richard Heyes. It was the host of a number of PHP and JavaScript libraries and scripts that
        were written by me - Richard Heyes. Indeed, RGraph started out life on the PHPGuru website.
        Though as it grew it matured and migrated on to its own website.

        <li>
            <b>RMail</b><br />
            A mime PHP library for sending HTML/text email with or without attachments.
            This library went through a lot of refining and bug fixes and as a result
            it's quite stable. Formerly RMail was called HTMLMimeMail (not a good name I know).<br />
            <a href="/pg-downloads"><b>Download</b></a>
            <br /><br />
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Xmail</b><br />
            An XML structure for email. It never became anything even approaching a
            standard - but it sure passed a lot of time.<br />
            <a href="/pg-downloads"><b>Download</b></a>
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>dynCalendar</b><br />
            A dynamic JavaScript calendar script. You can use this to make date pickers
            in forms - increasing the usability of said forms.<br />
            <a href="/pg-downloads"><b>Download</b></a>
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>TableEditor</b><br />
            A PHP/MySQL script for editing MySQL tables. The intention behind this was
            to create a portable bit of code that allows you to create customisable
            MySQL table editing interfaces easily. "Use phpMyAdmin" I hear you say. Well
            yes you could of course use that if you know what you're doing - but if you
            want an interface for users that don't have technical knowledge and don't
            want your database destroying every 2nd Tuesday - a stripped down interface
            like this becomes necessary.<br /><br />
            It was written circa 2005 and so it uses the old PHP MySQL API (the
            mysql_* functions) - but you could update them if you wanted.<br />

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>PEAR DB replacement</b><br />
            A MySQL specific drop-in replacement for the PEAR::DB abstraction layer.
            If you still use the PEAR::DB API but only with MySQL you could use this
            cutdown code and you may experience a small performance boost.<br /><br />
            There was no intent here to create a full abstraction API so it's quite
            small and tight.<br />
            <a href="/pg-downloads"><b>Download</b></a>
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Frederick</b>
            <br />A poorly named webmail client that I started some time ago but it
            didn't last particularly long.
            <a href="http://squirrelmail.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">
                There's a PHP webmail called Squirrel Mail.
            </a>
            Or there's always Gmail of course.<br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>SQLite.NET</b><br />
            A .NET (C#) SQLite database abstraction layer. This was a dabble with C#
            and whilst working well - it never had my full enthusiasm behind it.
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>HTML_Treemenu</b><br />
            A HTML/JavaScript script that makes using tree structured menus
            easier. It uses PHP to create JavaScript code. The
            JavaScript code creates a tree structure which then creates the menu.
            It uses a set of icons for the tree of which two are supplied in the
            download. They can of course be customised if you wish or entirely
            replaced with your own icons.
            <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTML_TreeMenu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">
                This can be retrieved from PEAR.
            </a><br /><br />
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>SMTP</b><br />
            Surprisingly, this was an SMTP class that you could use to send email. It
            may need a little tweaking as it's quite old - but it should still send
            email.<br />
            <a href="/pg-downloads"><b>Download</b></a>
            <br /><br />

        <li>
            <b>Toncarta</b>
            <br />A poorly named piece of code - this one was a caching system. This
            one is quite old - it was one of the first things that I wrote. So as such
            use it with that in mind!<br />

        <li>
            <b>PHP application structure</b><br />
            A document expounding the virtues of my own application structure. This
            structure that I use has stood the test of time and is versatile.<br />

            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Formproc3</b><br />
            A generic form processor that supports many different types of form
            element. This is another example of code that I wrote quite early on.<br />

            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Tree</b><br />
            A PHP class that makes creating and working with tree structures
            easier. There was two tree structures available - an object
            oriented based one and an array based structure. The object oriented
            example is more "classical" in design - but the array based class is
            faster and, in my opinion, easier to understand (should you feel the
            need to have a dig around). It will also serialize much better so it will
            be easier to store in a file or database if necessary.<br />

        <li>
            <b>PorterStemmer</b><br />
            A PHP implementation of Martin Porters word stemming algorithm. Word
            stemming is the process of shortening a word like <b>breathing</b> to
            <b>breath</b> so that searching for both for the word brings up both
            results.<br />

        <li>
            <b>Autocomplete</b><br />
            First created some time ago this is a JavaScript autocomplete widget
            that's designed to be used in your forms. It can improve the usability
            of your forms by speeding up the time necessary to complete them and
            also provide options to the user.<br />

        <li>
            <b>BrowserDetection</b><br />
            Quite old and hasn't been updated any time recently - this is some PHP
            browser detection. It uses UserAgent detection - now-a-days you might
            want to try using feature detection instead.<br />

            A lass that can be used to present information in a grid. There are lots
            of examples available in the download that allow you to get up and running
            quickly.<br />

            <b>PCRE Cheat sheet</b><br />
            This is a 2 page .pdf that describes the PCRE PHP functions. I would imagine
            that its missing a lot of functionality since its quite old - but the
            information that it does have will probably still be relevant.<br />

        <li>
            <b>POP3</b><br />
            Some code for connecting to and querying a POP3 server. POP3 can still be used
            (and is) when something like SSL (security) is not a requirement.

            <b>RTemplate</b><br />
            A basic templating "system" for PHP. There are a million and one templating systems
            that are available for PHP - but my current advice would be to use PHP if possible.
            It's far easier. And when combined with an opcode cache then it can be quite fast
            too.<br />

            A class for communicating with an SMTP server (for sending email). This
