There are several tools that we offer to our clients that will make setting up 
the website easier.</p>
<p>
The hosting control panel or <a href="http://www.greengeeks.com/vps-hosting/"title="cPanel" target="_blank">cPanel</a> is a tool for manage your websites and your hosting 
account. Make backups, create emails, import websites, run cron jobs and many

<p>
The one click script installation tool that is going to make it easy to install 
most of popular CMS and developed your website without the need to upload files 
with FTP. </p>
<p>
With those tools, a person will find that what would normally take days with one 
web host, is going to take a few minutes with us. Many other hosting companies 
out there are not going to offer such a convenient tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>PHP and MySql</h2>
<p>PHP is the most popular internet application language, very simple but the 
same time extremely powerful. With php hosting you can run dynamic websites and 
most of the CMS and applications who requires PHP. MySql comes to complete the 
package, php with mysql hosting is what 95% of the internet developers use for 
them websites. MySql database used for store and organize the data that is 
required from your PHP applications,&nbsp; is very fast reliable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CMS Hosting.</h2>
<p>
Though most web hosting companies out there offer a few select options to how a 
person can set up their web site or what type of program that they can use with 
their website, we do not place these restrictions on our clients. Instead, we 
have a variety of different programs that can be used when setting up a website. 
For example, drupal hosting, wordpress hosting, joomla hosting and 
forum&nbsp; hosting. Basically almost any PHP program 
that you want to use to build your web site is completely fine with us. We do not want to limit a person 
to what they can do, simply by not providing them an outlet that is convenient 
for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Free Hosting or Paid Hosting.</h2>
<p>Free hosting is good for new and small websites. If you are looking 
to host a high traffic or a big business site we suggest to advised 
from web hosting reviews websites for the right hosting provider for your needs. 
Cheap web hosting is very similar to free hosting, both are shared hosting 
services and cheap hosting can be a little faster than free web hosting and 
offer better support and many times comes with a free domain name. For business 
websites you may have to look for VPS hosting. VPS is a virtual server with 
dedicated resources only to you. Each web site have different needs and you have 
to choose the right hosting plan </p>
