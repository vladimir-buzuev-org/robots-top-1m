			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 id="noticeAndTakedown">NOTICE AND TAKEDOWN</h3>

				</p>
				<ol class="roman">
					<li>
						<p>

						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>

						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							a description of the copyright work that you claim has been infringed which should include, the type of work (such as a photograph or a video clip) and any relevant further details;
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							a description of the way in which the copyright material has been infringed;

				</p>
