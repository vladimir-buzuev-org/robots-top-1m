                        We have some great news! The transfer of all hosting services has gone smoothly, which means that it is time for domains transfers.
                        This is where we start the transfer of your domains over to Webafrica – a process which will be completed in batches from 15 to 22 April 2016.
                        We do not need you to do anything for this process to be completed successfully. While you will receive a transfer notice, you can safely ignore it.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Please Note:</strong> Do not decline the transfer when you receive your notice!

				</div>
				<div class="modal-body">
					<p>We know that moving can be stressful, but it's our mission to make this an easy shift and to keep you well informed throughout. <strong>Let's recap on a few important points and outline what to expect from your move over to us.</strong></p>

					<h4><i class="fa fa-server"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Migration of All Hosting Services from Serve-Hosting</h4>

					<p>We will begin the migration of all hosting services from Serve-Hosting to our data centre from <strong>Thursday, 31 March, to Friday, 15 April 2016</strong>. This will be a <strong>phased migration roll-out</strong> (done in batches).</p>
&nbsp;
					<p>We've planned the migration in such a way that minimal effort is required from your side. However, since we're moving you to new servers, the IP addresses will change. Here are a few scenarios where you'll need to make changes on the day of your migration:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Mail Clients (Outlook, etc.):</strong> If you are using the server <strong>IP address</strong> to connect to Serve-Hosting's email servers, you'll need to update it to <strong>'mail.[your domain name]'</strong>.</li>
						<li><strong>Database Connection Strings:</strong> If you are using the server <strong>IP address</strong> to connect to your database, you'll need to update the connection string to <strong>'localhost'</strong> instead.</li>
						<li><strong>Externally Managed Name Servers:</strong> If you are managing your DNS externally, we will send you the new DNS details shortly.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>You'll receive another communication from us closer to your actual migration event, explaining what else to expect during the move.</p>

					<h4><i class="fa fa-user-plus"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your New Account and Customer Zone Details</h4>

					<p><strong>We've created your new Webafrica account</strong> and sent you the login details via email to access your account. <strong>From Monday, 14 March onward</strong> you will need to manage all the services you have with Serve-Hosting within your new Webafrica Customer Zone. </p>

					<p>Your Webafrica Customer Zone is your <strong>one-stop Customer Portal</strong> where you can manage existing and order new services, log into your hosting control panel (cPanel), add email accounts, log a support ticket and do so <strong>MUCH MORE!</strong></p>

					<h4><i class="fa fa-credit-card"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;What's Changing? – Billing With Webafrica</h4>

					<p>We always like to keep things as they were, but due to your current billing dates with Serve-Hosting being slightly different to ours, there will be some minor changes. Here's what's to expect with us:</p>

					<p><strong>Customers already billed for a portion of March 2016:</strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Pro-rata March Invoice:</strong> Serve-Hosting has already billed you for a portion of March, and to bring you in line with our billing cycle, you will receive a pro-rata invoice from us for the remainder of March on the date you would normally receive your invoice from Serve-Hosting. Payment for this invoice is due by 7 April 2016.</li>
						<li><strong>April 2016 Invoice:</strong> Going forward, you will be invoiced on the 25th of every month. You will therefore receive your April invoice on 25 March 2016, which is due by 7 April 2016.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Customers already billed for a portion of April 2016:</strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Pro-rata April Invoice:</strong> Serve-Hosting has already billed you for a portion of April, and to bring you in line with our billing cycle, you will receive a pro-rata invoice from us for the remainder of April on the date you would normally receive your invoice from Serve-Hosting. Payment for this invoice is due by 7 May 2016.</li>
						<li><strong>May 2016 Invoice:</strong> Going forward, you will be invoiced on the 25th of every month. You will therefore receive your May invoice on 25 April 2016, which is due by 7 May 2016.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> all payments must be made to Webafrica, and if you pay via EFT find our banking details below:</p>

					<ul class="bank-details">
						<li><strong>Account name:</strong> WEB AFRICA NETWORKS (PTY) LTD</li>
						<li><strong>Account number:</strong> 071430903</li>
						<li><strong>Bank:</strong> Standard Bank of South Africa</li>
						<li><strong>Branch:</strong> Rondebosch, Cape Town</li>
						<li><strong>Branch (Sort) Code:</strong> 025009 (5009 for Standard Bank SA clients)</li>
						<li><strong>SWIFT Address:</strong> SBZAZAJJ</li>
					</ul>

					<h4><i class="fa fa-code-fork"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Existing Services – Package Name Change</h4>

					<p>You'll be happy to know that the price you're paying for your hosting services <strong>will not change</strong> – your package name will simply change to ensure that you are aligned to our current offerings. </p>



					<h4><i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Customer Support </h4>
					<p>During the migration you can continue to use <a href="mailto:info@serv.co.za">info@serv.co.za</a> for any support queries, and our friendly support team will assist you any time during <strong>06h00 – 00h00</strong> every day.</p>

					<p>Once again, <strong>welcome to Webafrica</strong>. We look forward to being your <strong>‘Everything Web’</strong> partner for many years to come.</p>
&nbsp;
					<p><strong>Take Care!</strong></p>
					<p><strong>The Webafrica Team</strong></p>
