It is about 17 km = 35 minutes. I will see you in meeting point. Firstly, you will visit a local market since Le King Dynasty 1428. It is the most famous market in the region where there are many traditional items for sales. If on Market Day (two or three times per week), people from all the surrounding villages would come to trade. People bring dogs, cats, pigs, chickens, ducks, and bamboo baskets to sell. Everyone is excited to meet each other on that day. You will be surprised about bustling and colorful market which is working under the canopy of old tree. You will see the old woman chew betel and areca nut and blacksmiths work hard with his bright brazier. \nIf not on market days, you still visit the nice market with local product for selling as: Fish, vegetable, fruits, meet shops and chickens and chatting with local people at the market.\nRight next to the market place, there are nice vegetable farms. We go around and visit vegetable fields growing a variety of produce including: bitter melon, cauliflower, cabbage, tomatoes, green peas, Chinese peas and corn, as well as fruit gardens with oranges, pomelos, papaya and more., and you may have chance to join a farmer working in his field on the way and ask experienced for local farmers about cultivation techniques and lifestyle.\nAfter that, you go to my house to cook delicious and traditional dishes, enjoy local fresh vegetable, fruit, make traditional cake and talk about Vietnamese family's custom together. I offer free tea and local drink.\n\nEXEMPLE MENU: \n\nSpring roll or Fresh noodle roll\nSour soup (bun rieu) served with rice noodle and herbs\nVegetable stir or salad\nTraditional cake\u002F che for dessert\nLocal beer\u002Fwine\nTea\nFresh fruits\n\nThe menu sometime changes depending on the season and on what is available at the market. \n\nAt the end of the meal, you can free walking around the village or take the taxi back Hanoi center.  \n- This tour I can host in the morning from 09:00 Am – 01:30 Pm and afternoon from 03:30  Pm - 07:30 Pm\n- The market is open in the morning only from 07 – 11:00 and there is no market in the afternoon.\n\n- From the Hoan Kiem Lake to my house is 17 km, I recommend you go by UBER taxi if possible, it is much cheaper and more comfortable\n\n- When you confirm booking with me, I will send you a direction in Vietnamese and my mobile phone number so you give to your driver he will take you to my home exactly.","localized_type":"Lunch"}],"avatar":{"id":376970,"account_id":13504,"path":"https:\u002F\u002Fuser-content.vizeat.com\u002Ff3747553-8c1f-4aef-826d-5746c58f50ca\u002FMeal2.jpg","uploadcare_id":"f3747553-8c1f-4aef-826d-5746c58f50ca","show":true,"attachable_id":13514,"attachable_type":"users","order":0},"languages":[{"alpha3-b":"eng","activated":true,"alpha2":"en","translated":true,"title":"English","locale":"en","id":40,"i_speak":"I speak english","alpha3-t":null}],"id":13514,"firstname":"Mandy bui","civility":"MRS","description":"Hi, I am Mandy Bui.

This is the rich heritage I in turn want to pass on now.\n\nToday, I am professional in the food sector. First, I worked for a company with organic products, then a large distribution with the products Reflets de France for Carrefour. \n\nAs mother of three, I also like to propose some cooking classes at my home. My guests usually are foreigners living in Paris, people who share a general interest in food and sometimes even tourists, who are looking for an authentic culinary experience “at home”. \n\nYou are welcome in my apartment and in my kitchen!\n\n\u002F\u002F\n\nPassionnée de cuisine depuis l’âge de 15 ans, j’ai toujours aimé regarder cuisiner ma mère et ma grand-mère.

They are both excellent cooks, who  would transform the products from the garden into simple yet delicious dishes. They passed their recipes on to me along with some tips and tricks and their joy of preparing something delicious and sharing it. This is the rich heritage I in turn want to pass on now.\n\nToday, I am professional in the food sector. First, I worked for a company with organic products, then a large distribution with the products Reflets de France for Carrefour. \n\nAs mother of three, I also like to propose some cooking classes at my home. My guests usually are foreigners living in Paris, people who share a general interest in food and sometimes even tourists, who are looking for an authentic culinary experience “at home”. \n\nYou are welcome in my apartment and in my kitchen!\n\n\u002F\u002F\n\nPassionnée de cuisine depuis l’âge de 15 ans, j’ai toujours aimé regarder cuisiner ma mère et ma grand-mère. Excellentes cuisinières, ce sont les produits du potager, du verger et de la basse-cour qu’elles transforment alors en plats simples mais savoureux. Tradition orale des recettes, gestes précis, astuces, goût du travail bien fait et amour à partager à travers les bons petits plats , c’est tout cet héritage que j’ai envie à mon tour de transmettre.\n\nAdulte, j’oriente ma carrière professionnelle dans l’agroalimentaire.
