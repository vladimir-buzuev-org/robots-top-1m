			<p>Our new website provides a much greater professional image to our customers whether they are accessing it from a home PC, tablet or smart phone. </p>
			
			<p>Working with you has been an absolute delight. Nothing was too much trouble and the whole process left us feeling more as friends than just a business customer. It all seemed too easy – and it was for us at our end.</p>
			
			<p>The initial rework was completed well within the expected time frame and our amendment requests to the draft site were actioned sometimes even within minutes. A very impressive response time.</p>
			
			<p>The upgrade makes customer online access easier for requesting prescriptions from a wider range of surgeries at a time to suit the customer. The additional list of new services we provide and the website links to external sources of information is extremely useful as a reference to point our customers toward.</p>
			
			<p>We cannot thank the Oldroyd Publishing team enough. They worked as a team; no matter who has answered the telephone or picked up our emails we have been treated with respect and had each stage of our upgrade explained thoroughly.  We are aware that there is no ‘I’ in team but Katy has stood out as a shining example who patiently hand held us through from start to finish. Thank you to everyone in the team, we are very grateful for your expertise and wonderful service.</p>

			<p>We are delighted with our website from Oldroyd Publishing Group.</p>
<p>The site was easy to set up and is quick and easy to administer. The online help is comprehensive and simple to access, and the customer service we received during set up was  first-class. Our enquiries were dealt with promptly, politely and knowledgeably at all times. I know that if we have any further questions we can contact a member of the team by phone or email and that they will deal with our points quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The website looks great, and we have had much positive feedback from patients, who are using it fully. The customizable reports on the website usage are extremely useful and are helping us to ensure the site continues to meet our patients' needs fully. Patients and staff see the website as a great way of quickly and economically accessing a wide range of information about the practice and about health in general.</p>
<p>We know that we have made the right decision in choosing OPG to host our website, and we look forward to continuing to work together in the future.</p>

			<p>I am very impressed with the quality of our website, I think it is user friendly and reflects us as a practice well. </p>
			<p>I am also very impressed with the ongoing process of developing our site, it is very easy to get it updated, I now have the ability to update the site directly myself or if I am pushed for time can quickly run off an email to OPG explaining what we need doing and it is done usually within 24 hours of me sending the email. </p>
			<p>I have found anyone I have ever had contact with to be incredibly friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble and if my request can't be fulfilled this is explained to me in a quickly and easy to understand way.</p>

I particularly find Katy Morson very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I know that I can approach her if I am finding something difficult to amend on the website and she will either guide me through this or amend it for me.</p>

			<p>Our website is really good. All the information is clear and the site is easy to navigate. There are no irrelevant pop ups that are often annoying. It is suitable to the service we provide and is aimed at the right level for our patients. Informative but friendly. Working with your team was fantastic. They did everything we asked and more! Always easy to contact and any changes we needed to have made were put in place really quickly. So easy to change to you for our website. Gave us a good amount of time to check and change things before we went live.</p>
			<p>Communication throughout was brilliant. Everyone I speak to is always so helpful. You have just put a patient questionnaire up for us which once again was done within 24 hours. I was talked through how to look and check the results. Nothing seems to be too much trouble which is so refreshing. Maintaining our old website took hours for just the smallest change, but I know that now we have your service in place everything will be sorted within a phone call.</p>

She was always very polite and courteous even when she had to chase us for outstanding copy; she was a pleasure to deal with and made the process run very smoothly (despite some delays at our end which must have been difficult for her to manage). Your designers kept to our design brief very well and the publication has a very strong look and feel that shows it is a Gateshead Council publication. The amendment process was very quick and amends were always done thoroughly. Print arrived quickly after sign off and I was kept informed throughout. The guides are a very good standard and are of high quality, the online eBook is also a good feature. In short, I would certainly recommend the service we received from you to other councils.</p>

          <p>I have been trying to get a website designed for about six years now but I have been regularly let down by the companies concerned and there has never been any wow factor.  I had never opened a website and gone &quot;Wow!&quot; Well, that is until now.</p>
      <p>It was great the way your team worked closely with me, taking me through the process one step at a time.  I am no expert when it comes to website design but I knew what I was looking for, so to check its development online was great. Everyone who has seen the websites have said how great they are. Thank you very much for making me two great websites.</p>

      <p>Your flair and skills are clear to see in both our sites and the results we are getting in terms of ever-increasing enquiries and sales have completely exceeded our expectations. </p>
      <p>We are especially pleased at how quickly you respond to our alterations and updates and of how you show such patience and understanding when dealing with us and our lack of in-depth knowledge of search engine optimisation etc. </p>

          <p>As a GP surgery we have used Oldroyd Publishing Group Ltd to design a website for our surgery and to keep it updated with new information. We have been extraordinarily happy with the excellent product and high level of service. Our surgery website looks better than I could have imagined and is performing very well in the search engines, which has led to more patients. I really couldn't possibly relay how pleased we've been with Oldroyd Publishing Group Ltd. If you are reading this review, consider yourself one of the lucky ones…you've found a truly talented, professional, honorable and reasonable web development company.</p>

          <p>I must say, the website you guys have created is perfect. The leaflet also matches this. It's been an enjoyable process and very easy. It's also very helpful that you are clued up with things like friends and family test, and automatically incorporated that onto our website. Well done to you all and I would certainly recommend you to any practice that are lost trying to find a good website creator.</p>
