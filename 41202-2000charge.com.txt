                                                credit card. Alternative payments are just as popular as credit card payments. However,
                                                not everyone has a credit card or likes to use them online. Especially outside the
                                                United States, credit card coverage is as low as 10% and is certainly not a widespread
                                                payment method.</p>
                                                <p>Consumers outside the United States like to pay with their well-established local
                                                payment methods or with those methods that they are accustomed to. 2000Charge offers
                                                merchants a variety of payment methods that will limit the exposure and risks involved
