# bots from executing the site's JavaScript code, which
# means that search engines capable of capturing a page 
# "preview" image will be unable to do so. This is
# desired behaviour because few bots will be sophisticated
# enough to execute the JavaScript of this site properly
# and rather than have the bot try and fail to execute the
# JavaScript, resulting in the preview image being one of
# a failure to execute, it is preferable to have no
# preview image at all.
