<li><p><a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/emergencyManagement.html#ecrit-lost-early-warning-00">"A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Early Warning Emergency Services and Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol Usage."</a> IETF Standards Track Internet Draft. October 26, 2008, expires April 29, 2009. Edited by <a href="mailto:br@brianrosen.net">Brian Rosen</a> (NeuStar, Inc) <a href="mailto:hgs+ecrit@cs.columbia.edu">Henning Schulzrinne</a> (Columbia University, Department of Computer Science), and <a href="mailto:Hannes.Tschofenig@gmx.net">Hannes Tschofenig</a> (Nokia Siemens Networks). Produced by members of the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/sipping-charter.html">IETF Session Initiation Proposal Investigation (SIPPING) Working Group</a>. The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is an XML document format for exchanging emergency alerts and public warnings. Different organizations issue alerts for specific geographical regions. The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol provides a way to discover servers that distribute these alerts for a geographical region. This document defines the Service Uniform Resource Names (URN)s for warnings in the same way as they have been defined with RFC 5031 for citizen-to-authority emergency services. Additionally, this document suggests to use LoST for the discovery of servers distributing alerts. This document makes use of RFC 5222 ("LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol"). However, instead of performing a translation from location information and a Service URN to a PSAP URI (plus supplementary information), as used with "Best Current Practice for Communications Services in support of Emergency Calling", for the citizen-to-authority emergency services use case, the LoST client asks the LoST server for a URI to receive further information on how to obtain warning alerts. In a response the URIs in the 'uri' element MUST be from the following format: sip, xmpp or http. The SIP URI MUST subsequently be used with "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)". An XMPP URI MUST be used as described in "Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) Over XMPP". An HTTP URI MUST be used with GeoRSS. In a LoST response the optional 'serviceNumber' element is not used by this specification. In mapping citizen-to-authority services, receiving multiple mappings is an exception. However, since many organizations may provide warnings for the same area, this is likely to be more common for alerts. As such, the extensions defined in "Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) Extensions" (<i>e.g.</i>, the ability to limit the number of returned mappings) are useful in this context...</p></li>

"We have developed a CMIS draft implementation in Sense/Net 6.0 Beta 2, soon to be released. It is possibly the first .NET implementation, as all supporting companies except from Microsoft are JAVA based. It is surely the first open source implementation on the .Net platform... Since Sense/Net 6.0 is both an Enterprise Portal and an Enterprise Content Management System, with its own Content Repository, we wanted to showcase how easy it is to use the .NET platform, WCF and Sense/Net 6.0 to implement the standard [see <a href="http://blog.sensenet.hu/image.axd?picture=SenseNet6.0-CMIS-ClientWebpart-20081103.jpg">screenshot</a>].  Our demo is a two way implementation, because our content repository has a CMIS service interface and our portal has a CMIS client Webpart (portlet). So other CMIS clients can access our contents, but our portal can aggregate content from other CMIS compliant systems, such as next generation SharePoint, Alfresco and others. We are also building <a href="http://cmis.sensenet.hu/">an online CMIS demo</a>, which is accessible from our website, but is under construction, so it might not work all the time. [<a href="http://cmis.sensenet.hu/Home/SimpleCMISClient">Simple CMIS Client</a>, <a href="http://cmis.sensenet.hu/Home/SimpleCMISAggregate">Simple CMIS Aggregate Client</a>] The demo features two CMIS webparts. One is able to navigate the content repository; the other is able to aggregate content from two sources that you can enter. The screenshot above is the CMIS test webpart, showing the PFS root contents. The services can also be accessed, just copy the URI-s from the input boxes. It even works with a simple browser, showing XML. There is no authentication, so no login is required. The source code will be available within a few days..."

Posted October 31, 2008 to the <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/msg20750.html">atom-syntax</a> list; with <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/threads.html#20750">followups</a>. Also available in <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/feeds/spec/draft-divilly-atompub-hierarchy-00.html">HTML format</a>. This specification defines a mechanism to create and remove AtomPub collections using the AtomPub protocol as well as to express hierarchies of feeds within the Atom Syndication Format.   Many applications provide their data in the form of syndicated Web feeds using formats such as Atom (RFC 4287 = Nottingham, M., Ed. and R. Sayre, Ed., <cite>The Atom Syndication Format,</cite> December 2005) in order to enable application integration. Applications may also manipulate the contents of these data feeds using protocols such as AtomPub (RFC 5023 = Gregorio, J. and B. de h&Oacute;ra, <cite>The Atom Publishing Protocol</cite>, October 2007). A key requirement for application data feeds is the ability to dynamically create new Collections and identify relationships among such feeds and Collections. This specification defines a mechanism for identifying hierarchical master-detail relations among data feeds so that consumer applications can perfrom standard AtomPub operations on them. A hierarchical master-detail relation of an Entry to a Feed implies the detail Feed is created when the master Entry is created and the Feed is removed when the Entry is removed. The Entry is called the "master entry" and the Feed is called "detail feed". This relationship allows a client to use AtomPub to create a new Collection by posting an Entry to an existing Collection... Protocol Model: Hierarchy extensions to Atom specify operations for creating, updating, and removing AtomPub Collections using existing AtomPub methods and extensions to Atom syntax. Feed Classification:  AtomPub defines Feed, Entry, and Collection resources in the Atom syntax; the hierarchy extensions to Atom are designed for use with unmodifiable Atom Feeds as well as with AtomPub Collections. The extensions in this specification define two specialized kinds of Feeds &mdash; master Feed and detail Feed. Both are represented as Atom Feed Documents..."</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/newsletter/news2008-10-27.html#cite1">"Microsoft Joins AMQP Working Group for Open Standards Messaging Software."</a> Staff, Microsoft Announcement. Microsoft Corp. announced that it is joining the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) Working Group, an organization focused on the development of the AMQP specification. Microsoft is joining the AMQP Working Group at the request of its members, including several of Microsoft's customers in the financial services industry, in order to support the development of an open industry standard for ubiquitous messaging. AMQP is a specification for platform-neutral, open standards-based business messaging. The primary goal of AMQP is to enable the communications necessary for business processes. AMQP Working Group members are collaborating on specifications for messaging infrastructure that provide businesses with a simple and more powerful way of connecting messaging-dependent applications both within and between firms. By joining the AMQP Working Group, Microsoft is seeking to contribute toward the development of such solutions and to enable greater customer choice in the marketplace. Message-based transports with security and transactional integrity are a vital infrastructure component throughout institutions. As Microsoft continues to provide vertical industry solutions, AMQP will provide an alternative to current messaging options. The AMQP specification and related implementations may provide greater interoperability for a number of vertical scenarios in addition to financial services, insurance and healthcare, among others. Members of the AMQP Working Group inculde Cisco, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Boerse Systems, Envoy Technologies Inc., The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., iMatix Corporation, IONA Technologies, J.P. Morgan, Novell, Rabbit Technologies Ltd., Red Hat Inc., TWIST Process Innovations Ltd., WSO2 and 29West Inc.</p></li>
