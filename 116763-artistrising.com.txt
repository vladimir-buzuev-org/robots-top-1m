		For the past 13 years we&rsquo;ve been lucky to work with so many exciting artists through our Artist Rising program.  We&rsquo;ve seen so many amazing original works of art from all of you; your boundless creativity and visions have been nothing short of inspiring. As it&rsquo;s said, all good things must come to an end, as of April 27, 2017 Artist Rising has closed shop. We hope to offer exciting new opportunities to share your art in the future.

	<p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>
	<p><strong>All of us at Art.com</strong></p>
