# robots.txt
#
# This file is to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts
# of your site by web crawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo
# and Google. By telling these robots where not to go on your site,
# you save bandwidth and server resources. This has been shown to be
# really important over the last few months as these robots seem to
# hit our sites hard
#
# This file will be ignored unless it is at the root of your host:
# Used:  http://example.com/robots.txt
# Ignored: http://example.com/site/robots.txt

# For more information about the robots.txt standard, see:
